abstract = {The segregation of centromeres and telomeres at mitosis is coordinated at multiple levels to prevent the formation of aneuploid cells, a phenotype frequently observed in cancer. Mitotic instability arises from chromosome segregation defects, giving rise to chromatin bridges at anaphase. Most of these defects are corrected before anaphase onset by a mechanism involving Aurora B kinase, a key regulator of mitosis in a wide range of organisms. Here, we describe a new role for Aurora B in telomere dispersion and disjunction during fission yeast mitosis. Telomere dispersion initiates in metaphase, whereas disjunction takes place in anaphase. Dispersion is promoted by the dissociation of Swi6/HP1 and cohesin Rad21 from telomeres, whereas disjunction occurs at anaphase after the phosphorylation of condensin subunit Cnd2. Strikingly, we demonstrate that deletion of Ccq1, a telomeric shelterin component, rescued cell death after Aurora inhibition by promoting the loading of condensin on chromosome arms. Our findings reveal an essential role for telomeres in chromosome arm segregation.},

abstract = {BubR1 kinase is essential for the mitotic checkpoint and also for kinetochores to establish microtubule attachments. In this study, we report that BubR1 is phosphorylated in mitosis on four residues that differ from sites recently reported to be phosphorylated by Plk1 (Elowe, S., S. Hummer, A. Uldschmid, X. Li, and E.A. Nigg. 2007. Genes Dev. 21:2205-2219; Matsumura, S., F. Toyoshima, and E. Nishida. 2007. J. Biol. Chem. 282:15217-15227). S670, the most conserved residue, is phosphorylated at kinetochores at the onset of mitosis and dephosphorylated before anaphase onset. Unlike the Plk1-dependent S676 phosphorylation, S670 phosphorylation is sensitive to microtubule attachments but not to kinetochore tension. Functionally, phosphorylation of S670 is essential for error correction and for kinetochores with end-on attachments to establish tension. Furthermore, in vitro data suggest that the phosphorylation status of BubR1 is important for checkpoint inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. Finally, RNA interference experiments show that Mps1 is a major but not the exclusive kinase that specifies BubR1 phosphorylation in vivo. The combined data suggest that BubR1 may be an effector of multiple kinases that are involved in discrete aspects of kinetochore attachments and checkpoint regulation.},

abstract = {Kinetochores are large protein assemblies built on chromosomal loci named centromeres. The main functions of kinetochores can be grouped under four modules. The first module, in the inner kinetochore, contributes a sturdy interface with centromeric chromatin. The second module, the outer kinetochore, contributes a microtubule-binding interface. The third module, the spindle assembly checkpoint, is a feedback control mechanism that monitors the state of kinetochore-microtubule attachment to control the progression of the cell cycle. The fourth module discerns correct from improper attachments, preventing the stabilization of the latter and allowing the selective stabilization of the former. In this review, we discuss how the molecular organization of the four modules allows a dynamic integration of kinetochore-microtubule attachment with the prevention of chromosome segregation errors and cell-cycle progression.},

@article{Raaijmakers2009,
abstract = {During mitosis, kinetochores need to attach to microtubules emanating from spindle poles. Several protein complexes have been shown to mediate the kinetochore-microtubule interaction. However, with the continually growing number of newly identified kinetochore proteins, it is unclear whether all major components of the kinetochore-microtubule interface have been identified. We therefore performed a high-throughput RNAi screen to identify additional factors involved in kinetochore-microtubule attachment, and identified RAMA1 as a novel regulator of this process. Depletion of RAMA1 results in severe chromosome alignment defects and a checkpoint-dependent mitotic arrest. We show that this is due to reduced kinetochore-microtubule attachments. RAMA1 localizes to the spindle and to outer kinetochores throughout all phases of mitosis and is recruited to kinetochores by the core kinetochore-microtubule attachment factor Hec1. Interestingly, unlike Hec1, the association of RAMA1 with kinetochores is highly dynamic, suggesting that it is not a structural component of the kinetochore. Consistent with this, all other kinetochore proteins tested do not require RAMA1 for their kinetochore localization. Taken together, these results identify RAMA1 as a novel kinetochore protein and suggest that RAMA1 may have a direct role in mediating kinetochore-microtubule interactions.},

abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation relies on dynamic interactions between microtubules (MTs) and the NDC80 complex, a major kinetochore MT-binding component. Phosphorylation at multiple residues of its Hec1 subunit may tune kinetochore-MT binding affinity for diverse mitotic functions, but molecular details of such phosphoregulation remain elusive. Using quantitative analyses of mitotic progression in mammalian cells, we show that Hec1 phosphorylation provides graded control of kinetochore-MT affinity. In contrast, modeling the kinetochore interface with repetitive MT binding sites predicts a switchlike response. To reconcile these findings, we hypothesize that interactions between NDC80 complexes and MTs are not constrained, i.e., the NDC80 complexes can alternate their binding between adjacent kinetochore MTs. Experiments using cells with phosphomimetic Hec1 mutants corroborate predictions of such a model but not of the repetitive sites model. We propose that accurate regulation of kinetochore-MT affinity is driven by incremental phosphorylation of an NDC80 molecular "lawn," in which the NDC80-MT bonds reorganize dynamically in response to the number and stability of MT attachments.},

@article{Tournier2004,
abstract = {In animal and yeast cells, the mitotic spindle is aligned perpendicularly to the axis of cell division. This ensures that sister chromatids are separated to opposite sides of the cytokinetic actomyosin ring. In fission yeast, spindle rotation is dependent upon the interaction of astral microtubules with the cortical actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we show that addition of Latrunculin A, which prevents spindle rotation, delays the separation of sister chromatids and anaphase promoting complex-mediated destruction of spindle-associated Securin and Cyclin B. Moreover, we find that whereas sister kinetochore pairs normally congress to the spindle midzone before anaphase onset, this congression is disrupted when astral microtubule contact with the actin cytoskeleton is disturbed. By analyzing the timing of kinetochore separation, we find that this anaphase delay requires the Bub3, Mad3, and Bub1 but not the Mad1 or Mad2 spindle assembly checkpoint proteins. In agreement with this, we find that Bub1 remains associated with kinetochores when spindles are mispositioned. These data indicate that, in fission yeast, astral microtubule contact with the medial cell cortex is monitored by a subset of spindle assembly checkpoint proteins. We propose that this checkpoint ensures spindles are properly oriented before anaphase takes place.},

@article{Cimini2004,
abstract = {Merotelic kinetochore orientation is a kinetochore misattachment in which a single kinetochore is attached to microtubules from both spindle poles instead of just one. It can be favored in specific circumstances [1-5], is not detected by the mitotic checkpoint, and induces lagging chromosomes in anaphase [6, 7]. In mammalian cells, it occurs at high frequency in early mitosis [5], but few anaphase cells show lagging chromosomes [5]. We developed live-cell imaging methods to determine whether and how the mitotic spindle prevents merotelic kinetochores from producing lagging chromosomes. We found that merotelic kinetochores entering anaphase never lost attachment to the spindle poles; they remained attached to both microtubule bundles, but this did not prevent them from segregating correctly. The two microtubule bundles usually showed different fluorescence intensities, the brighter bundle connecting the merotelic kinetochore to the correct pole. During anaphase, the dimmer bundle lengthened much more than the brighter bundle as spindle elongation occurred. This resulted in correct segregation of the merotelically oriented chromosome. We propose a model based on the ratios of microtubules to the correct versus incorrect pole for how anaphase spindle dynamics and microtubule polymerization at kinetochores prevent potential segregation errors deriving from merotelic kinetochore orientation.},

@article{Garcia2002d,
abstract = {Background: Metaphase is thought to be a force-equilibrium state of "tug of war," in which poleward forces are pulling kinetochores and counteracting the cohesive forces between the centromeres. Unlike conventional kinesins, members of the Kin I family are microtubule-depolymerizing enzymes, which are expected to be molecules that could generate poleward forces. Results: We have characterized mitotic roles of two Kin I homologs, Klp5 and Klp6, in fission yeast. Klp5 and Klp6 colocalize to the mitotic kinetochores and the spindle midzone. These two proteins form a heterocomplex, but not a homocomplex. Albeit not essential, both proteins are required for accurate chromosome segregation and normal morphology of interphase microtubules. Time-lapse live analysis using GFP-??-tubulin indicates that these mutants spend a much longer time (2-fold) in mitosis before the initiation of anaphase B. Further observation using kinetochore and centromere markers shows that, in these mutants, sister centromeres move back and forth between the two poles, indicating that entry into anaphase A is delayed. This is supported by live image analysis showing that Cut2 securin is retained during the prolonged mitosis. Furthermore, the mitotic extension is dependent upon the Mad2 spindle checkpoint. Conclusions: We discuss two models of Kin I function in fission yeast. One proposes that Klp5 and Klp6 are required for efficient capturing of kinetochores by the spindles, while the other proposes that they are required to generate tension upon kinetochore capturing. Kin I, therefore, plays a fundamental role in the establishment of metaphase, probably by generating poleward forces at the kinetochores.},

abstract = {Faithful segregation of sister chromatids requires the attachment of each kinetochore (Kt) to microtubules (MTs) that extend from opposite spindle poles. Merotelic Kt orientation is a Kt-MT misattachment in which a single Kt binds MTs from both spindle poles rather than just one. Genetic induction of merotelic Kt attachment during anaphase in fission yeast resulted in intra-Kt stretching followed by either correction or Kt disruption. Laser ablation of spindle MTs revealed that intra-Kt stretching and merotelic correction were dependent on MT forces. The presence of multiple merotelic chromosomes linearly antagonized the spindle elongation rate, and this phenomenon could be solved numerically using a simple force balance model. Based on the predictions of our mechanical model, we provide in vivo evidence that correction of merotelic attachment in anaphase is tension dependent and requires an Ase1/Prc1-dependent mechanism that prevents spindle collapse and thus asymmetric division and/or the appearance of the cut phenotype.},

Unlike condensin I, condensin II localizes to the nucleus during interphase, but it remains poorly understood what functions condensin II might have before mitotic entry. Here, we report that condensin II changes its chromatin-binding property during S phase. Remarkably, advanced premature chromosome condensation (PCC) assays enabled us to visualize condensin II forming "sister axes" in replicated regions of chromosomes in S phase cells. Depletion of condensin II compromised PCC-driven sister chromatid resolution during S phase. Moreover, fluorescence in situ hybridization assays revealed that condensin II, but not condensin I, promotes disjoining duplicated chromosomal loci during S phase. Application of mild replicative stress partially impaired this process and further exacerbated phenotypes arising from condensin II depletion. Our results suggest that condensin II initiates structural reorganization of duplicated chromosomes during S phase to prepare for their proper condensation and segregation in mitosis.},

abstract = {Kinetochores are macromolecular machines that couple chromosomes to dynamic microtubule tips during cell division, thereby generating force to segregate the chromosomes. Accurate segregation depends on selective stabilization of correct 'bi-oriented' kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which come under tension as the result of opposing forces exerted by microtubules. Tension is thought to stabilize these bi-oriented attachments indirectly, by suppressing the destabilizing activity of a kinase, Aurora B. However, a complete mechanistic understanding of the role of tension requires reconstitution of kinetochore-microtubule attachments for biochemical and biophysical analyses in vitro. Here we show that native kinetochore particles retaining the majority of kinetochore proteins can be purified from budding yeast and used to reconstitute dynamic microtubule attachments. Individual kinetochore particles maintain load-bearing associations with assembling and disassembling ends of single microtubules for >30 min, providing a close match to the persistent coupling seen in vivo between budding yeast kinetochores and single microtubules. Moreover, tension increases the lifetimes of the reconstituted attachments directly, through a catch bond-like mechanism that does not require Aurora B. On the basis of these findings, we propose that tension selectively stabilizes proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments in vivo through a combination of direct mechanical stabilization and tension-dependent phosphoregulation.},

abstract = {Fifty-two wee mutants that undergo mitosis and cell division at a reduced size compared with wild type have been genetically analyzed. The mutants define two genes, wee1 and cdc2, which control the timing of mitosis. Fifty-one of the mutants map at the wee1 locus, which is unlinked to any known cdc gene. One of the wee1 alleles has been shown to be nonsense suppressible. The 52nd wee mutant maps within cdc2. Previously, only temperature-sensitive mutants that become blocked at mitosis have been found at the cdc2 locus. The simplest interpretation of these observations is that wee1+ codes for a negative element or inhibitor, and cdc2+ codes for a positive element or activator in the mitotic control. The gene dosage of wee1+ plays some role in determining the timing of mitosis, but the gene dosage of cdc2+ has little effect. However, some aspect of the cdc2 gene product activity is important for determining when mitosis takes place. The possible roles of wee1 and cdc2 in the mitotic control are discussed, with particular reference to the part they may play in the monitoring of cell size and cell growth rate, both of which influence the timing of mitosis.

abstract = {Microtubule assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is initiated from sites within spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in the nuclear envelope. Microtubule plus ends are thought to be organized distal to the SPBs, while minus ends are proximal. Several hypotheses for the function of microtubule motor proteins in force generation and regulation of microtubule assembly propose that assembly and disassembly occur at minus ends as well as at plus ends. Here we analyse microtubule assembly relative to the SPBs in haploid yeast cells expressing green fluorescent protein fused to alpha-tubulin, a microtubule subunit. Throughout the cell cycle, analysis of fluorescent speckle marks on cytoplasmic astral microtubules reveals that there is no detectable assembly or disassembly at minus ends. After laser-photobleaching, metaphase spindles recover about 63{\%} of the bleached fluorescence, with a half-life of about 1 minute. After anaphase onset, photobleached marks in the interpolar spindle are persistent and do not move relative to the SPBs. In late anaphase, the elongated spindles disassemble at the microtubule plus ends. These results show for astral and anaphase interpolar spindle microtubules, and possibly for metaphase spindle microtubules, that microtubule assembly and disassembly occur at plus, and not minus, ends.},

abstract = {Error-free chromosome segregation requires stable attachment of sister kinetochores to the opposite spindle poles (amphitelic attachment). Exactly how amphitelic attachments are achieved during spindle assembly remains elusive. We employed photoactivatable GFP and high-resolution live-cell confocal microscopy to visualize complete 3D movements of individual kinetochores throughout mitosis in nontransformed human cells. Combined with electron microscopy, molecular perturbations, and immunofluorescence analyses, this approach reveals unexpected details of chromosome behavior. Our data demonstrate that unstable lateral interactions between kinetochores and microtubules dominate during early prometaphase. These transient interactions lead to the reproducible arrangement of chromosomes in an equatorial ring on the surface of the nascent spindle. A computational model predicts that this toroidal distribution of chromosomes exposes kinetochores to a high density of microtubules which facilitates subsequent formation of amphitelic attachments. Thus, spindle formation involves a previously overlooked stage of chromosome prepositioning which promotes formation of amphitelic attachments. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Molecular motors play critical roles in the formation of mitotic spindles, either through controlling the stability of individual microtubules, or by crosslinking and sliding microtubule arrays. Kinesin-8 motors are best known for their regulatory roles in controlling microtubule dynamics. They contain microtubule-destabilizing activities, and restrict spindle length in a wide variety of cell types and organisms. Here, we report an antiparallel microtubule-sliding activity of the budding yeast kinesin-8, Kip3. The in vivo importance of this sliding activity was established through the identification of complementary Kip3 mutants that separate the sliding activity and microtubule-destabilizing activity. In conjunction with Cin8, a kinesin-5 family member, the sliding activity of Kip3 promotes bipolar spindle assembly and the maintenance of genome stability. We propose a slide-disassemble model where the sliding and destabilizing activity of Kip3 balance during pre-anaphase. This facilitates normal spindle assembly. However, the destabilizing activity of Kip3 dominates in late anaphase, inhibiting spindle elongation and ultimately promoting spindle disassembly.},

Current models for microtubule assembly kinetics assume that the subunit dissociation rate from a microtubule tip is independent of free subunit concentration. Total-Internal-Reflection-Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy experiments and data from a laser tweezers assay that measures in vitro microtubule assembly with nanometer resolution, provides evidence that the subunit dissociation rate from a microtubule tip increases as the free subunit concentration increases. These data are consistent with a two-dimensional model for microtubule assembly, and are explained by a shift in microtubule tip structure from a relatively blunt shape at low free concentrations to relatively tapered at high free concentrations. We find that because both the association and the dissociation rates increase at higher free subunit concentrations, the kinetics of microtubule assembly are an order-of-magnitude higher than currently estimated in the literature. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In higher eukaryotes, the homologous complex probably resides in the middle domain of the trilaminar kinetochore, linking centromeric heterochromatin with microtubule-associated structures. We have prepared recombinant Ndc80 complex by pairwise coexpression of its components (Ndc80p and Nuf2p; Spc24p and Spc25p) and shown that they form independently stable subcomplexes. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy, combined with limited proteolysis and antibody labeling, demonstrates that the heterotetrameric Ndc80 complex is an approximately 570-A-long rod, with globular regions at either end. The shaft contains alpha-helical coiled-coil segments from each of the two subcomplexes, linked end-to-end. When integrated with published observations derived from inactivating the components of Ndc80, the molecular organization we deduce suggests that the Spc24p/Spc25p end of the rod faces the centromere and the Ndc80p/Nuf2p end faces a spindle microtubule.},

Quantitative mechanistic understanding of how spindle assembly can be both fast and accurate is lacking. Specifically, it is unclear how, if at all, chromosome movements and combining the centrosomal and chromosomal pathways affect the assembly speed and accuracy. We used computer simulations and high-resolution microscopy to test plausible pathways of spindle assembly in realistic geometry. Our results suggest that an optimal combination of centrosomal and chromosomal pathways, spatially biased microtubule growth, and chromosome movements and rotations is needed to complete prometaphase in 10-20 min while keeping erroneous merotelic attachments down to a few percent. The simulations also provide kinetic constraints for alternative error correction mechanisms, shed light on the dual role of chromosome arm volume, and compare well with experimental data for bipolar and multipolar HT-29 colorectal cancer cells.},

Here, we provide a quantitative analysis of kinetochore oscillations and positioning in S. Pombe, a model organism lacking chromokinesins. In wild type cells, chromosomes align during prophase and while oscillating, maintain this alignment throughout metaphase. Chromosome oscillations are dispensable both for kinetochore congression and stable kinetochore alignment during metaphase. In higher eukaryotes, Kinesin-8 controls chromosome congression by regulating their oscillations. Oppositely, we demonstrate that fission yeast Kinesin-8 controls chromosome congression by an alternative mechanism. We propose that Kinesin-8 aligns chromosomes by controlling pulling forces in a length dependent manner. A coarse grained model of chromosome segregation implemented with a length-dependent process that controls the force at kinetochores is necessary and sufficient to mimic kinetochore alignment and prevents the appearance of lagging chromosomes. Altogether, these data illustrate how the local action of a motor protein at kinetochores provides spatial cues within the spindle to align chromosomes and to prevent aneuploidy.},

Unlike budding yeast, the fission yeast complex is non-essential, however it promotes bipolar microtubule attachment in conjunction with microtubule-depolymerising kinesin-8 Klp5 and Klp6. Here, we screened for dam1 temperature sensitive mutants in a klp5 null background and identified dam1-A8 that contains two amino acid substitutions in the C-terminus (H126R and E149G). dam1-A8klp5 mutant cells display massive chromosome missegregation with lagging chromosomes and monopolar attachment of sister chromatids to one SPB (spindle pole body). Unexpectedly contrary to a deletion mutant that is hypersensitive to microtubule-destabilising drugs, dam1-A8 is resistant and furthermore the temperature sensitivity of dam1-A8klp5 is rescued by addition of these drugs. This indicates that the hyper-stabilised rigidity of kinetochore-spindle mal-attachments is the primary cause of lethality. Our result shows that fine-tuning of Dam1 activity is essential for chromosome bi-orientation. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Despite correction mechanisms, merotelically attached kinetochores can persist until anaphase, causing chromatids to lag on the mitotic spindle and hindering their timely segregation. Recent studies showing that merotelic kinetochore attachment represents a major mechanism of aneuploidy in mitotic cells and is the primary mechanism of chromosomal instability in cancer cells have underlined the importance of studying merotely. Here, we highlight recent progress in our understanding of how cells prevent and correct merotelic kinetochore attachments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Microtubule length control is essential for the assembly and function of the mitotic spindle. Kinesin-like motor proteins that directly attenuate microtubule dynamics make key contributions to this control, but the specificity of these motors for different subpopulations of spindle microtubules is not understood. Kif18A (kinesin-8) localizes to the plus-ends of the relatively slow growing kinetochore fibers (K-fibers) and attenuates their dynamics, while Kif4A (kinesin-4) localizes to mitotic chromatin and suppresses the growth of highly dynamic, non-kinetochore microtubules. While Kif18A and Kif4A similarly suppress microtubule growth in vitro, it remains unclear whether microtubule-attenuating motors control the lengths of K-fibers and non-kinetochore microtubules through a common mechanism. To address this question, we engineered chimeric kinesins that contain the Kif4A, Kif18B (kinesin-8) or Kif5B (kinesin-1) motor domain fused to the C-terminal tail of Kif18A. Each of these chimeric kinesins localizes to K-fibers, however, K-fiber length control requires an activity specific to kinesin-8s. Mutational studies of Kif18A indicate that this control depends on both its C-terminus and a unique, positively charged surface loop, called loop2, within the motor domain. These data support a model in which microtubule-attenuating kinesins are molecularly "tuned" to control the dynamics of specific subsets of spindle microtubules.},

abstract = {Metaphase chromosome positioning depends on Kif18A, a kinesin-8 that accumulates at and suppresses the dynamics of K-MT plus ends. By engineering Kif18A mutants that suppress MT dynamics but fail to concentrate at K-MT plus ends, we identify a mechanism that allows Kif18A to accumulate at K-MT plus ends to a level required to suppress chromosome movements. Enrichment of Kif18A at K-MT plus ends depends on its C-terminal tail domain, while the ability of Kif18A to suppress MT growth is conferred by the N-terminal motor domain. The Kif18A tail contains a second MT-binding domain that diffuses along the MT lattice, suggesting that it tethers the motor to the MT track. Consistently, the tail enhances Kif18A processivity and is crucial for it to accumulate at K-MT plus ends. The heightened processivity of Kif18A, conferred by its tail domain, thus promotes concentration of Kif18A at K-MT plus ends, where it suppresses their dynamics to control chromosome movements.},

However, mutated or altered expression of mitotic checkpoint genes accounts for a minor proportion of human tumors. We describe a Drosophila melanogaster tumorigenesis model derived from knocking down spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) genes and preventing apoptosis in wing imaginal discs. Bub3-deficient tumors that were also deficient in apoptosis displayed neoplastic growth, chromosomal aneuploidy, and high proliferative potential after transplantation into adult flies. Inducing aneuploidy by knocking down CENP-E and preventing apoptosis does not induce tumorigenesis, indicating that aneuploidy is not sufficient for hyperplasia. In this system, the aneuploidy caused by a deficient SAC is not driving tumorigenesis because preventing Bub3 from binding to the kinetochore does not cause hyperproliferation. Our data suggest that Bub3 has a nonkinetochore-dependent function that is consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor.},

At kinetochore-microtubule plus ends, the kinesin-8 family member Kif18A is essential to align mitotic chromosomes at the spindle equator during cell division, but how it accomplishes this function is unclear. We report here that Kif18A is a plus-end-directed motor that inhibits the polymerization dynamics of microtubule plus ends without destabilizing them, distinguishing Kif18A from the budding yeast ortholog Kip3. In interphase cells, Kif18A uses this activity to reduce the overall dynamicity of microtubule plus ends and effectively constrains the distance over which plus ends grow and shrink. Our findings suggest that kinesin-8 family members have developed biochemically distinct activities throughout evolution and have implications for how Kif18A affects kinetochore-microtubule plus-end dynamics during mitosis in animal cells. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Fission yeast Klp5 and Klp6 belong to the microtubule-destabilizing Kin I family. In klp5 mutants, spindle checkpoint proteins Mad2 and Bub1 are recruited to mitotic kinetochores for a prolonged duration, indicating that these kinetochores are unattached. Further analysis shows that there are kinetochores to which only Bub1, but not Mad2, localizes. These kinetochores are likely to have been captured, yet lack tension. Thus Klp5 and Klp6 play a role in a spindle- kinetochore interaction at dual steps, capture and generation of tension. The TOG/XMAP215 family, Alp14 and Dis1 are known to stabilize microtubules and be required for the bivalent attachment of the kinetochore to the spindle. Despite apparent opposing activities towards microtubule stability, Klp5/Klp6 and Alp14/Dis1 share an essential function, as either dis1klp or alp14klp mutants are synthetically lethal, like alp14dis1. Defective phenotypes are similar to each other, characteristic of attachment defects and chromosome mis-segregation. Furthermore Alp14 is of significance for kinetochore localization of Klp5. We propose that Klp5/Klp6 and Alp14/Dis1 play a collaborative role in bipolar spindle formation during prometaphase through producing spindle dynamism.},

Here we demonstrate that orderly progression through the major events of the cell cycle can be driven by oscillation of an engineered monomolecular cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) module lacking much of the canonical regulation. We show further that the CDK oscillator acts as the primary organizer of the cell cycle, imposing timing and directionality to a system of two CDK activity thresholds that define independent cell cycle phases. We propose that this simple core architecture forms the basic control of the eukaryotic cell cycle.},

abstract = {The microtubule cytoskeleton and the mitotic spindle are highly dynamic structures, yet their sizes are remarkably constant, thus indicating that the growth and shrinkage of their constituent microtubules are finely balanced. This balance is achieved, in part, through kinesin-8 proteins (such as Kip3p in budding yeast and KLP67A in Drosophila) that destabilize microtubules. Here, we directly demonstrate that Kip3p destabilizes microtubules by depolymerizing them--accounting for the effects of kinesin-8 perturbations on microtubule and spindle length observed in fungi and metazoan cells. Furthermore, using single-molecule microscopy assays, we show that Kip3p has several properties that distinguish it from other depolymerizing kinesins, such as the kinesin-13 MCAK. First, Kip3p disassembles microtubules exclusively at the plus end and second, remarkably, Kip3p depolymerizes longer microtubules faster than shorter ones. These properties are consequences of Kip3p being a highly processive, plus-end-directed motor, both in vitro and in vivo. Length-dependent depolymerization provides a new mechanism for controlling the lengths of subcellular structures.},

Interphase chromosomes are not positioned randomly within the nucleus, but instead adopt preferred conformations. Disparate DNA elements co-localize into functionally defined aggregates or 'factories' for transcription and DNA replication. In budding yeast, Drosophila and many other eukaryotes, chromosomes adopt a Rabl configuration, with arms extending from centromeres adjacent to the spindle pole body to telomeres that abut the nuclear envelope. Nonetheless, the topologies and spatial relationships of chromosomes remain poorly understood. Here we developed a method to globally capture intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions, and applied it to generate a map at kilobase resolution of the haploid genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The map recapitulates known features of genome organization, thereby validating the method, and identifies new features. Extensive regional and higher order folding of individual chromosomes is observed. Chromosome XII exhibits a striking conformation that implicates the nucleolus as a formidable barrier to interaction between DNA sequences at either end. Inter-chromosomal contacts are anchored by centromeres and include interactions among transfer RNA genes, among origins of early DNA replication and among sites where chromosomal breakpoints occur. Finally, we constructed a three-dimensional model of the yeast genome. Our findings provide a glimpse of the interface between the form and function of a eukaryotic genome.},

abstract = {The motions of mitotic chromosomes are complex and show considerable variety across species. A wealth of evidence supports the idea that microtubule-dependent motor enzymes contribute to this variation and are important both for spindle formation and for the accurate completion of chromosome segregation. Motors that walk towards the spindle pole are, however, dispensable for at least some poleward movements of chromosomes in yeasts, suggesting that depolymerizing spindle microtubules can generate mitotic forces in vivo. Tubulin protofilaments that flare outward in association with microtubule shortening may be the origin of such forces, because they can move objects that are appropriately attached to a microtubule wall. For example, some kinetochore-associated proteins can couple experimental objects, such as microspheres, to shortening microtubules in vitro, moving them over many micrometers. Here, we review recent evidence about such phenomena, highlighting the force-generation mechanisms and different coupling strategies. We also consider bending filaments of the tubulin-like protein FtsZ, which form rings girding bacteria at their sites of cytokinesis. Mechanical similarities between these force-generation systems suggest a deep phylogenetic relationship between tubulin depolymerization in eukaryotic mitosis and FtsZ-mediated ring contraction in bacteria.},

Typically, chromosomes align at the metaphase spindle equator where they oscillate along the pole-pole axis before disjoining and moving poleward during anaphase A, but spindles in different cell types display differences in MT dynamicity, in the amplitude of chromosome oscillations and in rates of chromatid-to-pole motion. Drosophila embryonic mitotic spindles, for example, display remarkably dynamic MTs, barely detectable metaphase chromosome oscillations, and a rapid rate of "flux-pacman-dependent" anaphase chromatid-to-pole motility. Here we develop a force-balance model that describes Drosophila embryo chromosome motility in terms of a balance of forces acting on kinetochores and kMTs that is generated by multiple polymer ratchets and mitotic motors coupled to tension-dependent kMT dynamics. The model shows that i), multiple MTs displaying high dynamic instability can drive steady and rapid chromosome motion; ii), chromosome motility during metaphase and anaphase A can be described by a single mechanism; iii), high kinetochore dynein activity is deployed to dampen metaphase oscillations, to augment the basic flux-pacman mechanism, and to drive rapid anaphase A; iv), modulation of the MT rescue frequency by the kinetochore-associated kinesin-13 depolymerase promotes metaphase chromosome oscillations; and v), this basic mechanism can be adapted to a broad range of spindles.},

Kinetochore movements are coupled to single microtubule plus-end polymerization/depolymerization at kinetochore attachment sites. Here, we use computer modeling to test possible mechanisms controlling chromosome alignment during yeast metaphase by simulating experiments that determine the 1) mean positions of kinetochore Cse4-GFP, 2) extent of oscillation of kinetochores during metaphase as measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of kinetochore Cse4-GFP, 3) dynamics of kMTs as measured by FRAP of GFP-tubulin, and 4) mean positions of unreplicated chromosome kinetochores that lack pulling forces from a sister kinetochore. We rule out a number of possible models and find the best fit between theory and experiment when it is assumed that kinetochores sense both a spatial gradient that suppresses kMT catastrophe near the poles and attachment site tension that promotes kMT rescue at higher amounts of chromatin stretch.},

In budding yeast, the 10-protein Dam1 complex is an Aurora kinase target that plays essential roles maintaining the integrity of the mitotic spindle and regulating interactions with the kinetochore. Here, we investigated the biochemical properties of purified Dam1 complex. The complex oligomerized into rings around microtubules. Ring formation was facilitated by microtubules but could occur in their absence. Mutant alleles led to partially assembled complexes or reduced microtubule binding. The interaction between rings and microtubules is mediated by the C termini of both Dam1 and ????-tubulin. Ring formation promotes microtubule assembly, stabilizes against disassembly, and promotes bundling. A GTP-tubulin lattice is the preferred binding partner for the complex, and Dam1 rings can exhibit lateral mobility on microtubules. These observations suggest a mechanism by which the kinetochore can recognize and stay attached to the plus ends of microtubules.},

What should it be? And how can it contribute to solving the big questions in biology? The past decade has seen very rapid development of quantitative experimental techniques, especially at the single-molecule and single-cell levels. In this essay, I argue that quantitative biology is much more than just the quantitation of these experimental results. Instead, it should be the application of the scientific method by which measurement is directed toward testing theories. In this view, quantitative biology is the recognition that theory and models play critical roles in biology, as they do in physics and engineering. By tying together experiment and theory, quantitative biology promises a deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms, when the theory works, or to new discoveries, when it does not.},

It has been suggested that the dynamic properties of MTs are central to the organization of the eukaryotic intracellular space, and that they are involved in the control of cell morphology, but the actual mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we present a theoretical analysis in which we explore the possibility that a system of dynamic MTs and MT end-tracking molecular motors is providing specific positional information inside cells. We compute the MT length distribution for the case of MT-length-dependent switching between growing and shrinking states, and analyze the accumulation of molecular motors at the tips of growing MTs. Using these results, we show that a transport system consisting of dynamic MTs and associated motor proteins can deliver cargo proteins preferentially to specific positions within the cell. Comparing our results with experimental data in the model organism fission yeast, we propose that the suggested mechanisms could play important roles in setting length scales during cellular morphogenesis. ?? 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The spindle checkpoint is a surveillance system acting in mitosis to delay anaphase onset until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle [1, 2]. When the checkpoint is activated, the Mad2 and Mad3 proteins directly bind and inhibit Cdc20, which is an essential activator of an E3 ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) [3]. When the checkpoint is satisfied, Cdc20-APC is activated and polyubiquitinates securin and cyclin, leading to the dissolution of sister chromatid cohesion and mitotic progression. Several protein kinases play critical roles in spindle checkpoint signaling, but the mechanism (or mechanisms) by which they inhibit mitotic progression remains unclear [4]. Furthermore, it is not known whether their activity needs to be reversed by protein phosphatases before anaphase onset can occur. Here we employ fission yeast to show that Aurora (Ark1) kinase activity is directly required to maintain spindle checkpoint arrest, even in the presence of many unattached kinetochores. Upon Ark1 inhibition, checkpoint complexes are disassembled and cyclin B??is rapidly degraded. Importantly, checkpoint silencing and??cyclin B degradation require the kinetochore-localized isoform of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1Dis2). We propose that PP1Dis2-mediated dephosphorylation of checkpoint components forms a novel spindle checkpoint silencing mechanism. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Proper mitotic chromosome segregation requires dynamic interactions between spindle microtubules and kinetochores. Here we demonstrate that two related fission yeast kinesins, klp5(+) and klp6(+), are required for normal chromosome segregation in mitosis. Null mutants frequently lack a normal metaphase chromosome alignment. Chromosome pairs move back and forth along the spindle for an extended period prior to sister chromatid separation, a phenotype reminiscent of the loss of CENP-E in metazoans. Ultimately, sister chromatids segregate, regardless of chromosome position along the spindle, and viable daughter cells are usually produced. The initiation of anaphase B is sometimes delayed, but the rate of spindle elongation is similar to wildtype. Despite a delay, anaphase B often begins before anaphase A is completed. The klp5Delta and klp6Delta null mutants are synthetically lethal with a deletion of the spindle assembly checkpoint gene, bub1(+), several mutants in components of the anaphase promoting complex, and a cold sensitive allele of the kinetochore and microtubule-binding protein, Dis1p. Klp5p-GFP and Klp6p-GFP localize to kinetochores from prophase to the onset of anaphase A, but relocalize to the spindle midzone during anaphase B. These data indicate that Klp5p and Klp6p are kinetochore kinesins required for normal chromosome movement in prometaphase.},

Microtubules exert extensional pulling force on sister chromatids toward opposite poles, whereas pericentric chromatin resists with contractile springlike properties. Tension generated from these opposing forces silences the spindle checkpoint to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. It is unknown how the cell senses tension across multiple microtubule attachment sites, considering the stochastic dynamics of microtubule growth and shortening. In budding yeast, there is one microtubule attachment site per chromosome. By labeling several chromosomes, we find that pericentromeres display coordinated motion and stretching in metaphase. The pericentromeres of different chromosomes exhibit physical linkage dependent on centromere function and structural maintenance of chromosomes complexes. Coordinated motion is dependent on condensin and the kinesin motor Cin8, whereas coordinated stretching is dependent on pericentric cohesin and Cin8.

abstract = {Proliferation of mammalian cells requires the coordinated function of many proteins to accurately divide a cell into two daughter cells. Several RNAi screens have identified previously uncharacterised genes that are implicated in mammalian cell division. The molecular function for these genes needs to be investigated to place them into pathways. Phenotypic profiling is a useful method to assign putative functions to uncharacterised genes. Here, we show that the analysis of protein localisation is useful to refine a phenotypic profile. We show the utility of this approach by defining a function of the previously uncharacterised gene C13orf3 during cell division. C13orf3 localises to centrosomes, the mitotic spindle, kinetochores, spindle midzone, and the cleavage furrow during cell division and is specifically phosphorylated during mitosis. Furthermore, C13orf3 is required for centrosome integrity and anaphase onset. Depletion by RNAi leads to mitotic arrest in metaphase with an activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and loss of sister chromatid cohesion. Proteomic analyses identify C13orf3 (Ska3) as a new component of the Ska complex and show a direct interaction with a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase PP2A. All together, these data identify C13orf3 as an important factor for metaphase to anaphase progression and highlight the potential of combined RNAi screening and protein localisation analyses.},

abstract = {Microtubule self-assembly is largely governed by the chemical kinetics and thermodynamics of tubulin-tubulin interactions. An important aspect of microtubule assembly is that hydrolysis of the beta-tubulin-associated GTP promotes protofilament curling. Protofilament curling presumably drives the transition from tip structures associated with growth (sheetlike projections and blunt ends) to those associated with shortening (rams' horns and frayed ends), and transitions between these structures have been proposed to be important for growth-shortening transitions. However, previous models for microtubule dynamic instability have not considered such structures or mechanics explicitly. Here we present a three-dimensional model that explicitly incorporates mechanical stress and strain within the microtubule lattice. First, we found that the model recapitulates three-dimensional tip structures and rates of assembly and disassembly for microtubules grown under standard conditions, and we propose that taxol may stabilize microtubule growth by reducing flexural rigidity. Second, in contrast to recent suggestions, it was determined that sheetlike tips are more likely to undergo catastrophe than blunt tips. Third, partial uncapping of the tubulin-GTP cap provides a possible mechanism for microtubule pause events. Finally, simulations of the binding and structural effects of XMAP215 produced the experimentally observed growth and shortening rates, and tip structure.},

The kinetochore is composed of a number of conserved protein complexes that direct its specification and assembly, bind to spindle microtubules and regulate chromosome segregation. Recent studies have identified more than 80 kinetochore components, and are revealing how these proteins are organized into the higher order kinetochore structure, as well as how they function to achieve proper chromosome segregation.},

The proposed method can be described by two main steps. Initially, image segmentation based on the k-means algorithm is performed to separate different types of cells from the background. Then, a robust and efficient strategy is performed on the blob contour for touching cells splitting. Due to the contour processing, the method achieves excellent results of detection compared to manual detection performed by specialists.},

The process of cell division is essential to the maintenance of every form of life. However, a detailed quantitative understanding of mitosis has been difficult owing to the complexity of the process. Indeed, it has been long recognized that, because of the complexity of the molecules involved, their dynamics and their properties, the mitotic events that mediate the segregation of the genome into daughter nuclei cannot be fully understood without the contribution of mathematical/quantitative modelling. Here, we provide an overview of mitosis and describe the dynamic and mechanical properties of the mitotic apparatus. We then discuss several quantitative models that emerged in the past decades and made an impact on our understanding of specific aspects of mitosis, including the motility of the chromosomes within the mitotic spindle during metaphase and anaphase, the maintenance of spindle length during metaphase and the switch to spindle elongation that occurs during anaphase.},

Understanding how it is regulated and integrated with other cellular processes requires a comprehensive analysis of its molecular constituents and general design principles. Here, we developed a new strategy to phenotypically profile the human genome with respect to transferrin (TF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) endocytosis by combining RNA interference, automated high-resolution confocal microscopy, quantitative multiparametric image analysis and high-performance computing. We identified several novel components of endocytic trafficking, including genes implicated in human diseases. We found that signalling pathways such as Wnt, integrin/cell adhesion, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and Notch regulate the endocytic system, and identified new genes involved in cargo sorting to a subset of signalling endosomes. A systems analysis by Bayesian networks further showed that the number, size, concentration of cargo and intracellular position of endosomes are not determined randomly but are subject to specific regulation, thus uncovering novel properties of the endocytic system.},

abstract = {The coupling of kinetochores to dynamic spindle microtubules is crucial for chromosome positioning and segregation, error correction, and cell cycle progression. How these fundamental attachments are made and persist under tensile forces from the spindle remain important questions. As microtubule-binding elements, the budding yeast Ndc80 and Dam1 kinetochore complexes are essential and not redundant, but their distinct contributions are unknown. In this study, we show that the Dam1 complex is a processivity factor for the Ndc80 complex, enhancing the ability of the Ndc80 complex to form load-bearing attachments to and track with dynamic microtubule tips in vitro. Moreover, the interaction between the Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes is abolished when the Dam1 complex is phosphorylated by the yeast aurora B kinase Ipl1. This provides evidence for a mechanism by which aurora B resets aberrant kinetochore-microtubule attachments. We propose that the action of the Dam1 complex as a processivity factor in kinetochore-microtubule attachment is regulated by conserved signals for error correction.},

We developed a method to purify metaphase and anaphase chromosomes from frog egg extracts and identified proteins that leave chromosomes at anaphase using a new form of expression screening. This approach identified Xkid, a Xenopus homolog of human Kid (kinesin-like DNA binding protein) as a protein that is degraded in anaphase by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Immunodepleting Xkid from egg extracts prevented normal chromosome alignment on the metaphase spindle. Adding a mild excess of wild-type or nondegradable Xkid to egg extracts prevented the separated chromosomes from moving toward the poles.

abstract = {Most models of mitotic congression and segregation assume that only poleward pulling forces occur at kinetochores. However, there are reports for several different cell types that both mono-oriented and bi-oriented chromosomes oscillate toward and away from the pole throughout mitosis. We used new methods of high resolution video microscopy and computer-assisted tracking techniques to measure the positions over time of individual kinetochores with respect to their poles during mitosis in living newt lung cells. The results show that kinetochores oscillate throughout mitosis when they are tethered to spindle poles by attachment to the plus-ends of kinetochore microtubules (kMTs). Oscillations were not sinusoidal. Instead, kinetochores abruptly (as quick as 6 s or less) switched between persistent (approximately 1.5 min average duration) phases of poleward (P) and away from the pole (AP) movement. This kinetochore "directional instability" was a property of motility at the plus-ends of kMTs since fluorescent marks on the lattice of kMTs have previously been observed to exhibit only relatively slow P movement. Each P and AP phase consisted of one or a few constant velocity domains (approximately 1.7 microns/min average velocity). Velocities of P and AP phases were similar from prometaphase through mid-anaphase. Kinetochores occasionally switched to an indeterminant (N) phase of no or confused motion, which was usually brief compared to the durations of P and AP phases. Net chromosome displacements that occurred during congression to the equator or poleward movement during anaphase were primarily generated by differences in the durations and not the velocities of P and AP movements. Careful analysis of centromere deformation showed that kinetochore P movement produced pulling forces while kinetochore AP movement produced pushing forces. These data show that kinetochore directional instability is fundamental to the processes of chromosome congression and segregation. We argue that tension at the kinetochore attachment site is a key factor which controls the switching between P and AP phases of kinetochore motion.},

abstract = {How sister kinetochores attach to microtubules from opposite spindle poles during mitosis (bi-orientation) remains poorly understood. In yeast, the ortholog of the Aurora B-INCENP protein kinase complex (Ipl1-Sli15) may have a role in this crucial process, because it is necessary to prevent attachment of sister kinetochores to microtubules from the same spindle pole. We investigated IPL1 function in cells that cannot replicate their chromosomes but nevertheless duplicate their spindle pole bodies (SPBs). Kinetochores detach from old SPBs and reattach to old and new SPBs with equal frequency in IPL1+ cells, but remain attached to old SPBs in ipl1 mutants. This raises the possibility that Ipl1-Sli15 facilitates bi-orientation by promoting turnover of kinetochore-SPB connections until traction of sister kinetochores toward opposite spindle poles creates tension in the surrounding chromatin.},

abstract = {Microtubules (MTs) are central to the organisation of the eukaryotic intracellular space and are involved in the control of cell morphology. For these purposes, MT polymerisation dynamics are tightly regulated. Using automated image analysis software, we investigate the spatial dependence of MT dynamics in interphase fission yeast cells with unprecedented statistical accuracy. We find that MT catastrophe frequencies (switches from polymerisation to depolymerisation) strongly depend on intracellular position. We provide evidence that compressive forces generated by MTs growing against the cell pole locally reduce MT growth velocities and enhance catastrophe frequencies. Furthermore, we find evidence for an MT length-dependent increase in the catastrophe frequency that is mediated by kinesin-8 proteins (Klp5/6). Given the intrinsic susceptibility of MT dynamics to compressive forces and the widespread importance of kinesin-8 proteins, we propose that similar spatial regulation of MT dynamics plays a role in other cell types as well. In addition, our systematic and quantitative data should provide valuable input for (mathematical) models of MT organisation in living cells.},

Deflation by subtracting detected peaks allows detection of lower-intensity peaks. We exhaustively detected particles using MTT, with performance reaching theoretical limits, and then reconnected trajectories integrating the statistical information from past trajectories.

Active force interplay exists between predominantly extensional microtubule-based spindle forces and restoring forces from chromatin. These forces regulate tension at the kinetochore that silences the spindle assembly checkpoint to ensure faithful chromosome segregation. Depletion of pericentric cohesin or condensin has been shown to increase the mean and variance of spindle length, which have been attributed to a softening of the linear chromatin spring. Models of the spindle apparatus with linear chromatin springs that match spindle dynamics fail to predict the behavior of pericentromeric chromatin in wild-type and mutant spindles. We demonstrate that a nonlinear spring with a threshold extension to switch between spring states predicts asymmetric chromatin stretching observed in vivo. The addition of cross-links between adjacent springs recapitulates coordination between pericentromeres of neighboring chromosomes.},

@article{Hays1982,
abstract = {We are investigating the relation between the force pulling a kinetochore poleward and the length of the corresponding kinetochore fiber. It was recognized by Ostergren in 1950 (Hereditas 36:1-19) that the metaphase position of a chromosome could be achieved by a balance of traction forces were proportional to the distance from kinetochore to pole. For the typical chromosome (i.e., a meiotic bivalent or mitotic chromosome) with a single kinetochore fiber extending to each pole, the resultant force (RF) would equal zero when the chromosome lay at the midpoint between the two poles. For special chromosomes that have unequal numbers of kinetochore fibers extending towards opposite poles. For special chromosomes that have unequal numbers of kinetochore fibers extending towards opposite poles. For special chromosomes that have unequal numbers of kinetochore fibers extending towards opposite poles, Ostergren's proposal suggests that RF = 0 when the chromosome is shifted closer to the pole toward which the greater number of kinetochore fibers are pulling. We have measured the force-length relationship in living spindles by analyzing the metaphase positions of experimentally generated multivalent chromosomes having three or four kinetochore fibers. Multivalent chromosomes of varied configurations were generated by gamma-irradiation of nymphs of the grasshopper melanoplus differentialis, and their behavior was analyzed in living first meiotic spermocytes. The lengths of kinetochore fibers were determined from time-lapse photographs by measuring the kinetochore-to-pole distances for fully congressed chromosomes just before the onset of anaphase. In our analysis, force (F) along a single kinetochore fiber is expressed by: F = kL(exp), where k is a length-independent proportionality constant, L represents the kinetochore fiber length, and exp is an unknown exponent. The RF on a chromosome is then given by: RF = sigmak(i)L(i)(exp), where kinetochore fiber lengths in opposite half- spindles are given opposite sign. If forces on a metaphase chromosome are at equilibrium (RF = 0), then for asymmetrical orientations of multivalents we can measure the individual kinetochore fiber lengths (L(i)) and solve for the exponent that yields a resultant force of zero. The value of the exponent relates how the magnitude of force along a kinetochore fiber varies with its length. For six trivalents and one naturally occurring quadrivalent we calculated an average value of exp = 1.06 +/- 0.18. This result is consistent with Ostergren's hypothesis and indicates that the magnitude of poleward traction force along a kinetochore fiber is directly proportional to the length of the fiber. Our finding suggests that the balance of forces along a kinetochore fiber may be a major factor regulating the extent of kinetochore microtubule assembly.},

abstract = {The stable propagation of genetic material during cell division depends on the congression of chromosomes to the spindle equator before the cell initiates anaphase. It is generally assumed that congression requires that chromosomes are connected to the opposite poles of the bipolar spindle ("bioriented"). In mammalian cells, we found that chromosomes can congress before becoming bioriented. By combining the use of reversible chemical inhibitors, live-cell light microscopy, and correlative electron microscopy, we found that monooriented chromosomes could glide toward the spindle equator alongside kinetochore fibers attached to other already bioriented chromosomes. This congression mechanism depended on the kinetochore-associated, plus end-directed microtubule motor CENP-E (kinesin-7).},

abstract = {During mitosis and meiosis, the spindle assembly checkpoint acts to maintain genome stability by delaying cell division until accurate chromosome segregation can be guaranteed. Accuracy requires that chromosomes become correctly attached to the microtubule spindle apparatus via their kinetochores. When not correctly attached to the spindle, kinetochores activate the spindle assembly checkpoint network, which in turn blocks cell cycle progression. Once all kinetochores become stably attached to the spindle, the checkpoint is inactivated, which alleviates the cell cycle block and thus allows chromosome segregation and cell division to proceed. Here we review recent progress in our understanding of how the checkpoint signal is generated, how it blocks cell cycle progression and how it is extinguished. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Interfaces between spindle microtubules and kinetochores were examined in diverse species by electron tomography and image analysis. Overall structures were conserved in a mammal, an alga, a nematode, and two kinds of yeasts; all lacked dense outer plates, and most kinetochore microtubule ends flared into curved protofilaments that were connected to chromatin by slender fibrils. Analyses of curvature on >8,500 protofilaments showed that all classes of spindle microtubules displayed some flaring protofilaments, including those growing in the anaphase interzone. Curved protofilaments on anaphase kinetochore microtubules were no more flared than their metaphase counterparts, but they were longer. Flaring protofilaments in budding yeasts were linked by fibrils to densities that resembled nucleosomes; these are probably the yeast kinetochores. Analogous densities in fission yeast were larger and less well-defined, but both yeasts showed ring- or partial ring-shaped structures girding their kinetochore microtubules. Flaring protofilaments linked to chromatin are well placed to exert force on chromosomes, assuring stable attachment and reliable anaphase segregation.},

Depending on the system, sister chromatids may display either of two distinct behaviors, namely (1) the presence or (2) the absence of oscillations about the metaphase plate. Significantly, in PtK1 cells, in which chromosome behavior appears to be dependent on the position along the metaphase plate, both types of behavior are observed within the same spindle, but how and why these distinct behaviors are manifested is unclear. Here, we developed a new quantitative model to describe metaphase chromosome dynamics via kinetochore-microtubule interactions mediated by nonmotor viscoelastic linkages. Our model reproduces all the key features of metaphase sister kinetochore dynamics in PtK1 cells and suggests that differences in the distribution of polar ejection forces at the periphery and in the middle of PtK1 cell spindles underlie the observed dichotomy of chromosome behavior.},

To understand the mechanism of kinesin movement, X-ray crystallography has been used to study the atomic structures of kinesin. However, as crystal structures of kinesin alone accumulate, it is becoming clear that kinesin structures should also be investigated with the microtubule to understand the contribution of the microtubule track to the nucleotide-induced conformational changes of kinesin. Recently, several high-resolution structures of kinesin with microtubules were obtained using cryo-electron microscopy. Comparison with X-ray crystallographic structures revealed the importance of the microtubule in determining the conformation of kinesin.

In this technique, one end of a microtubule is attached to the tip of a flexible glass fiber of calibrated stiffness. The other end of the microtubule makes contact with a surface sparsely coated with kinesin. By imaging the tip of the glass fiber on a photodiode detector, displacement of the microtubule by kinesin through as little as 1 nm can be detected and forces as small as 1 pN resolved. Using this force-fiber apparatus we have characterized the mechanical output of this molecular motor. The speed at which a molecule of kinesin moved along the surface of a microtubule decreased linearly as the elastic force was increased. The force required to stop a single kinesin molecule was 5.4 +/- 1.0 pN (mean +/- SD; n = 16), independent of the stiffness of the fiber, the damping from the fluid, and whether the ATP concentration was high or low.},

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, monopolar attachment is established in haploid cells, indicating that homologous chromosomes are dispensable for its establishment. This monopolar attachment requires both mating pheromone signaling and inactivation of Pat1 kinase (a key negative regulator of meiosis). It also requires the meiotic cohesin factor Rec8 but not the recombination factor Rec12. In contrast, in diploid cells, monopolar attachment is established by Pat1 inactivation alone, and does not require mating pheromone signaling. Furthermore, monopolar attachment requires Rec12 in addition to Rec8. These results indicate that monopolar attachment of sister chromatids can be established by two distinct mechanisms in S.pombe, one that is pheromone dependent and recombination independent, and a second that is pheromone independent and recombination dependent. We propose that co-operation of these two mechanisms generates the high fidelity of monopolar attachment.},

abstract = {The 'simple' view of the mitotic spindle is that it self-assembles as a result of microtubules (MTs) randomly searching for chromosomes, after which the spindle length is maintained by a balance of outward tension exerted by molecular motors on the MTs connecting centrosomes and chromosomes, and compression generated by other motors on the MTs connecting the spindle poles. This picture is being challenged now by mounting evidence indicating that spindle assembly and maintenance rely on much more complex interconnected networks of microtubules, molecular motors, chromosomes and regulatory proteins. From an engineering point of view, three design principles of this molecular machine are especially important: the spindle assembles quickly, it assembles accurately, and it is mechanically robust--yet malleable. How is this design achieved with randomly interacting and impermanent molecular parts? Here, we review recent interdisciplinary studies that have started to shed light on this question. We discuss cooperative mechanisms of spindle self-assembly, error correction and maintenance of its mechanical properties, speculate on analogy between spindle and lamellipodial dynamics, and highlight the role of quantitative approaches in understanding the mitotic spindle design.},

abstract = {Microtubules are key structural and transport elements in cells. The dynamics at microtubule ends are characterized by periods of slow growth, followed by stochastic switching events termed "catastrophes," in which microtubules suddenly undergo rapid shortening [1]. Growing microtubules are thought to be protected from catastrophe by a GTP-tubulin "cap": GTP-tubulin subunits add to the tips of growing microtubules but are subsequently hydrolyzed to GDP-tubulin subunits once they are incorporated into the microtubule lattice [2-4]. Loss of the GTP-tubulin cap exposes GDP-tubulin subunits at the microtubule tip, resulting in a catastrophe event [5-9]. However, the mechanistic basis for sudden loss of the GTP cap, leading to catastrophe, is not known. To investigate microtubule catastrophe events, we performed 3D mechanochemical simulations that account for interactions between neighboring protofilaments [10-12]. We found that there are two separate factors that contribute to catastrophe events in the 3D simulation: the GTP-tubulin cap size, which settles into a steady-state value that depends on the free tubulin concentration during microtubule growth, and the structure of the microtubule tip. Importantly, 3D simulations predict, and both fluorescence and electron microscopy experiments confirm, that microtubule tips become more tapered as the microtubule grows. This effect destabilizes the tip and ultimately contributes to microtubule catastrophe. Thus, the likelihood of a catastrophe event may be intimately linked to the aging physical structure of the growing microtubule tip. These results have important consequences for catastrophe regulation in cells, as microtubule-associated proteins could promote catastrophe events in part by modifying microtubule tip structures. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The maintenance of cooperation in populations where public goods are equally accessible to all but inflict a fitness cost on individual producers is a long-standing puzzle of evolutionary biology. An example of such a scenario is the secretion of siderophores by bacteria into their environment to fetch soluble iron. In a planktonic culture, these molecules diffuse rapidly, such that the same concentration is experienced by all bacteria. However, on solid substrates, bacteria form dense and packed colonies that may alter the diffusion dynamics through cell-cell contact interactions. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa microcolonies growing on solid substrate, we found that the concentration of pyoverdine, a secreted iron chelator, is heterogeneous, with a maximum at the center of the colony. We quantitatively explain the formation of this gradient by local exchange between contacting cells rather than by global diffusion of pyoverdine. In addition, we show that this local trafficking modulates the growth rate of individual cells. Taken together, these data provide a physical basis that explains the stability of public goods production in packed colonies.},

Classical studies and recent work provide a framework to dissect the mechanisms, functions, and consequences of force at kinetochores.},

abstract = {Mitotic spindles of Schizosaccharomyces pombe have been studied by EM, using serial cross sections to reconstruct 12 spindles from cells that were ultrarapidly frozen and fixed by freeze substitution. The resulting distributions of microtubules (MTs) have been analyzed by computer. Short spindles contain two kinds of MTs: continuous ones that run from pole to pole and MTs that originate at one pole and end in the body of the spindle. Among the latter there are three pairs of MT bundles that end on fibrous, darkly staining structures that we interpret as kinetochores. The number of MTs ending at each putative kinetochore ranges from two to four; all kinetochore-associated MTs disappear as the spindle elongates from 3-6 mum. At this and greater spindle lengths, there are no continuous MTs, only polar MTs that interdigitate at the spindle midzone, but the spindle continues to elongate. An analysis of the density of neighboring MTs at the midzone of long spindles shows that their most common spacing is approximately 40 nm, center to center, and that there is a preferred angular separation of 90-degrees. Only hints of such square-packing are found at the midzone of short spindles, and near the poles there is no apparent order at any mitotic stage. Our data suggest that the kinetochore MTs (KMTs) do not interact directly with nonkinetochore MTs, but that interdigitating MTs from the two spindle poles do interact to form a mechanically stable bundle that connects the poles. As the spindle elongates, the number of MTs decreases while the mean length of the MTs that remain increases. We conclude that the chromosomes of S. pombe become attached to the spindle by kinetochore MTs, that these MTs disappear as the chromosomes segregate, that increased separation of daughter nuclei is accompanied by a sliding apart of anti-parallel MTs, and that the mitotic processes of S. pombe are much like those in other eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {To ensure equal chromosome segregation during mitosis, the macromolecular kinetochore must remain attached to depolymerizing microtubules, which drive chromosome movements. How kinetochores associate with depolymerizing microtubules, which undergo dramatic structural changes forming curved protofilaments, has yet to be defined in vertebrates. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved kinetochore-localized Ska1 complex tracks with depolymerizing microtubule ends and associates with both the microtubule lattice and curved protofilaments. In contrast, the Ndc80 complex, a central player in the kinetochore-microtubule interface, binds only to the straight microtubule lattice and lacks tracking activity. We demonstrate that the Ska1 complex imparts its tracking capability to the Ndc80 complex. Finally, we present a structure of the Ska1 microtubule-binding domain that reveals its interaction with microtubules and its regulation by Aurora B. This work defines an integrated kinetochore-microtubule interface formed by the Ska1 and Ndc80 complexes that associates with depolymerizing microtubules, potentially by interacting with curved microtubule protofilaments. Microtubule depolymerization-driven chromosome movements are essential for chromosome segregation. Schmidt et al. demonstrate that the human Ska1 and Ndc80 complexes form an integrated kinetochore-microtubule interface that tracks depolymerizing microtubule ends. The Ska1 complex utilizes a winged-helix domain to associate with both the straight microtubule lattice and curved protofilament structures. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {An ellipse can be fit to an arbitrary shape using a linear least squares approach applied to boundary data. Alternatively, this problem can also be solved by calculating the second moments of the entire region, a technique popular in image analysis applications. If the irregular shape can be approximated by a polygon then Greens theorem allows efficient calculation of the second moments. If the shape is pixelated then the second moments can be calculated by a simple summation process. By considering the behaviour of these fitting methods with increasing deformation it is shown that as an arbitrary shape passively deforms, the best-fit ellipse also behaves as if it were deforming passively. This implies that all techniques of strain analysis that were previously restricted to populations of elliptical objects may now be applied to populations of arbitrary shapes, provided the best-fit ellipse is calculated by one of the methods described here. Furthermore it implies that selective sampling based on shape or methods of weighting based upon shape are invalid and tend to bias the raw data. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mitotic spindle positioning by cortical pulling forces defines the cell division axis and location, which is critical for proper cell division and development. Although recent work has identified developmental and extrinsic cues that regulate spindle orientation, the contribution of intrinsic signals to spindle positioning and orientation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that cortical force generation in human cells is controlled by distinct spindle-pole- and chromosome-derived signals that regulate cytoplasmic dynein localization. First, dynein exhibits a dynamic asymmetric cortical localization that is negatively regulated by spindle-pole proximity, resulting in spindle oscillations to centre the spindle within the cell. We find that this signal comprises the spindle-pole-localized polo-like kinase (Plk1), which regulates dynein localization by controlling the interaction between dynein-dynactin and its upstream cortical targeting factors NuMA and LGN. Second, a chromosome-derived RanGTP gradient restricts the localization of NuMA-LGN to the lateral cell cortex to define and maintain the spindle orientation axis. RanGTP acts in part through the nuclear localization sequence of NuMA to locally alter the ability of NuMA-LGN to associate with the cell cortex in the vicinity of chromosomes. We propose that these chromosome- and spindle-pole-derived gradients generate an intrinsic code to control spindle position and orientation.},

abstract = {The adaptor protein 1 (AP1) complex is a heterotetramer that participates in cargo sorting into clathrin-coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. The gamma subunit of AP1 possesses a C-terminal "ear" domain that recruits a cohort of accessory proteins through recognition of a shared canonical motif, PsiG[PDE][PsiLM] (where Psi is an aromatic residue). The physiological relevance of these ear-motif interactions, however, remains to be demonstrated. Here we report that the cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) has two sequences fitting this motif, FGPL and FGEF, which mediate binding to the AP1-gamma-ear domain in vitro. Mutation of both gamma-ear-binding sequences or depletion of AP1-gamma by RNA interference (RNAi) decreases the association of GAK with the TGN in vivo. Depletion of GAK by RNAi impairs the sorting of the acid hydrolase, cathepsin D, to lysosomes. Importantly, expression of RNAi-resistant GAK restores the lysosomal sorting of cathepsin D in cells depleted of endogenous GAK, whereas expression of a similar construct bearing mutations in both gamma-ear-binding sequences fails to correct the sorting defect. Thus, interactions between the PsiG[PDE][PsiLM]-motif sequences in GAK and the AP1-gamma-ear domain are critical for the recruitment of GAK to the TGN and the function of GAK in lysosomal enzyme sorting.},

abstract = {Chromosome positioning at the equator of the mitotic spindle emerges out of a relatively entropic background. At this moment, termed metaphase, all kinetochores have typically captured microtubules leading to satisfaction of the spindle-assembly checkpoint, but the cell does not enter anaphase immediately. The waiting time in metaphase is related to the kinetics of securin and cyclin B1 degradation, which trigger sister-chromatid separation and promote anaphase processivity, respectively. Yet, as judged by metaphase duration, such kinetics vary widely between cell types and organisms, with no evident correlation to ploidy or cell size. During metaphase, many animal and plant spindles are also characterized by a conspicuous "flux" activity characterized by continuous poleward translocation of spindle microtubules, which maintain steady-state length and position. Whether spindle microtubule flux plays a specific role during metaphase remains arguable. Based on known experimental parameters, we have performed a comparative analysis amongst different cell types from different organisms and show that spindle length, metaphase duration and flux velocity combine within each system to obey a quasi-universal rule. As so, knowledge of two of these parameters is enough to estimate the third. This trend indicates that metaphase duration is tuned to allow approximately one kinetochore-to-pole round of microtubule flux. We propose that the time cells spend in metaphase evolved as a quality enhancement step that allows for the uniform stabilization/correction of kinetochore-microtubule attachments, thereby promoting mitotic fidelity.},

abstract = {During mitosis, kinetochores form persistent attachments to microtubule tips and undergo corrective detachment in response to phosphorylation by Ipl1 (Aurora B) kinase. The Dam1 complex is required to establish and maintain bi-oriented attachment to microtubule tips in vivo, and it contains multiple sites phosphorylated by Ipl1 (Refs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Moreover, a number of kinetochore-like functions can be reconstituted in vitro with pure Dam1 complex. These functions are believed to derive from the ability of the complex to self-assemble into rings. Here we show that rings are not necessary for dynamic microtubule attachment, Ipl1-dependent modulation of microtubule affinity or the ability of Dam1 to move processively with disassembling microtubule tips. Using two fluorescence-based assays, we found that the complex exhibited a high affinity for microtubules (Kd of approximately 6 nM) that was reduced by phosphorylation at Ser 20, a single Ipl1 target residue in Dam1. Moreover, individual complexes underwent one-dimensional diffusion along microtubules and detached 2.5-fold more frequently after phosphorylation by Ipl1. Particles consisting of one to four Dam1 complexes - too few to surround a microtubule - were captured and carried by disassembling tips. Thus, even a small number of binding elements could provide a dynamic, phosphoregulated microtubule attachment and thereby facilitate accurate chromosome segregation.},

Here we use a combination of quantitative live-cell imaging and reconstituted dynamic microtubule assays to investigate the molecular control of mitotic centromere movements. We establish that Kif18A (kinesin-8) attenuates centromere movement by directly promoting microtubule pausing in a concentration-dependent manner. This activity provides the dominant mechanism for restricting centromere movement to the spindle midzone. Furthermore, polar ejection forces spatially confine chromosomes via position-dependent regulation of kinetochore tension and centromere switch rates. We demonstrate that polar ejection forces are antagonistically modulated by chromokinesins. These pushing forces depend on Kid (kinesin-10) activity and are antagonized by Kif4A (kinesin-4), which functions to directly suppress microtubule growth. These data support a model in which Kif18A and polar ejection forces synergistically promote centromere alignment via spatial control of kinetochore-microtubule dynamics.},

These polypeptides colocalize throughout the vegetative cell cycle as they bind cytoplasmic microtubules during interphase, spindle microtubules, and/or kinetochores during early mitosis, and the interpolar spindle as it elongates in anaphase B. Here, we describe in vitro properties of these motor proteins and some truncated versions expressed in either bacteria or Sf9 cells. The motor-plus-neck domain of Klp6p formed soluble dimers that cross-linked microtubules and showed both microtubule-activated ATPase and plus-end-directed motor activities. Full-length Klp5p and Klp6p, coexpressed in Sf9 cells, formed soluble heterodimers with the same activities. The latter recombinant protein could also couple microbeads to the ends of shortening microtubules and use energy from tubulin depolymerization to pull a load in the minus end direction. These results, together with the spindle localizations of these proteins in vivo and their requirement for cell viability in the absence of the Dam1/DASH kinetochore complex, support the hypothesis that fission yeast kinesin-8 contributes both to chromosome congression to the metaphase plate and to the coupling of spindle microtubules to kinetochores during anaphase A.},

It has long been assumed that ciliary length-control mechanisms are essential for proper flow generation, because fluid flow generation is a function of ciliary length. However, the molecular mechanisms of ciliary length control in mammals remain elusive. Here, we suggest that KIF19A, a member of the kinesin superfamily, regulates ciliary length by depolymerizing microtubules at the tips of cilia. Kif19a-/- mice displayed hydrocephalus and female infertility phenotypes due to abnormally elongated cilia that cannot generate proper fluid flow. KIF19A localized to cilia tips, and recombinant KIF19A controlled the length of microtubules polymerized from axonemes in vitro. KIF19A had ATP-dependent microtubule-depolymerizing activity mainly at the plus end of microtubules. Our results indicated a molecular mechanism of ciliary length regulation in mammals, which plays an important role in the maintenance of the mammalian body. The mechanism that determines ciliary length is essential for proper fluid flow generation. Niwa et al. find that KIF19A regulates the length of motile cilia by depolymerizing microtubules at ciliary tips. Disruption of this mechanism causes ciliopathy-like phenotypes such as hydrocephalus and female infertility. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Several theoretical models have been proposed for how these sites generate force, and molecular diffusion of kinetochore components has been proposed as a key component that facilitates kinetochore function. However, these models do not explicitly take into account the recently observed flexibility of kinetochore components and variations in microtubule shape under load. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model for kinetochore-microtubule connections that directly incorporates these two important components, namely, flexible kinetochore binder elements, and the effects of tension load on the shape of shortening microtubule tips. We compare our results with existing biased diffusion models and explore the role of protein flexibility inforce generation at the kinetochore-microtubule junctions. Our model results suggest that kinetochore component flexibility and microtubule shape variation under load significantly diminish the need for high diffusivity (or weak specific binding) of kinetochore components; optimal kinetochore binder stiffness regimes are predicted by our model. Based on our model results, we suggest that the underlying principles of biased diffusion paradigm need to be reinterpreted.},

@article{Vasquez1997,
abstract = {Previous studies demonstrated that nanomolar concentrations of nocodazole can block cells in mitosis without net microtubule disassembly and resulted in the hypothesis that this block was due to a nocodazole-induced stabilization of microtubules. We tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of nanomolar concentrations of nocodazole on microtubule dynamic instability in interphase cells and in vitro with purified brain tubulin. Newt lung epithelial cell microtubules were visualized by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy and cells were perfused with solutions of nocodazole ranging in concentration from 4 to 400 nM. Microtubules showed a loss of the two-state behavior typical of dynamic instability as evidenced by the addition of a third state where they exhibited little net change in length (a paused state). Nocodazole perfusion also resulted in slower elongation and shortening velocities, increased catastrophe, and an overall decrease in microtubule turnover. Experiments performed on BSC-1 cells that were microinjected with rhodamine-labeled tubulin, incubated in nocodazole for 1 h, and visualized by using low-light-level fluorescence microscopy showed similar results except that nocodazole-treated BSC-1 cells showed a decrease in catastrophe. To gain insight into possible mechanisms responsible for changes in dynamic instability, we examined the effects of 4 nM to 12 microM nocodazole on the assembly of purified tubulin from axoneme seeds. At both microtubule plus and minus ends, perfusion with nocodazole resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in elongation and shortening velocities, increase in pause duration and catastrophe frequency, and decrease in rescue frequency. These effects, which result in an overall decrease in microtubule turnover after nocodazole treatment, suggest that the mitotic block observed is due to a reduction in microtubule dynamic turnover. In addition, the in vitro results are similar to the effects of increasing concentrations of GDP-tubulin (TuD) subunits on microtubule assembly. Given that nocodazole increases tubulin GTPase activity, we propose that nocodazole acts by generating TuD subunits that then alter dynamic instability.},

abstract = {Actin filaments and microtubules polymerize and depolymerize by adding and removing subunits at polymer ends, and these dynamics drive cytoplasmic organization, cell division, and cell motility. Since Wegner proposed the treadmilling theory for actin in 1976, it has largely been assumed that the chemical state of the bound nucleotide determines the rates of subunit addition and removal. This chemical kinetics view is difficult to reconcile with observations revealing multiple structural states of the polymer that influence polymerization dynamics but that are not strictly coupled to the bound nucleotide state. We refer to these phenomena as "structural plasticity" and discuss emerging evidence that they play a central role in polymer dynamics and function.},

abstract = {The mitotic checkpoint prevents cells with unaligned chromosomes from prematurely exiting mitosis by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) from targeting key proteins for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. We have examined the mechanism by which the checkpoint inhibits the APC/C by purifying an APC/C inhibitory factor from HeLa cells. We call this factor the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) as it consists of hBUBR1, hBUB3, CDC20, and MAD2 checkpoint proteins in near equal stoichiometry. MCC inhibitory activity is 3,000-fold greater than that of recombinant MAD2, which has also been shown to inhibit APC/C in vitro. Surprisingly, MCC is not generated from kinetochores, as it is also present and active in interphase cells. However, only APC/C isolated from mitotic cells was sensitive to inhibition by MCC. We found that the majority of the APC/C in mitotic lysates is associated with the MCC, and this likely contributes to the lag in ubiquitin ligase activity. Importantly, chromosomes can suppress the reactivation of APC/C. Chromosomes did not affect the inhibitory activity of MCC or the stimulatory activity of CDC20. We propose that the preformed interphase pool of MCC allows for rapid inhibition of APC/C when cells enter mitosis. Unattached kinetochores then target the APC/C for sustained inhibition by the MCC.},

abstract = {Members of the kinesin-8 motor class have the remarkable ability to both walk towards microtubule plus-ends and depolymerise these ends on arrival, thereby regulating microtubule length. To analyse how kinesin-8 multitasks, we studied the structure and function of the kinesin-8 motor domain. We determined the first crystal structure of a kinesin-8 and used cryo-electron microscopy to calculate the structure of the microtubule-bound motor. Microtubule-bound kinesin-8 reveals a new conformation compared with the crystal structure, including a bent conformation of the $\alpha$4 relay helix and ordering of functionally important loops. The kinesin-8 motor domain does not depolymerise stabilised microtubules with ATP but does form tubulin rings in the presence of a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue. This shows that, by collaborating, kinesin-8 motor domain molecules can release tubulin from microtubules, and that they have a similar mechanical effect on microtubule ends as kinesin-13, which enables depolymerisation. Our data reveal aspects of the molecular mechanism of kinesin-8 motors that contribute to their unique dual motile and depolymerising functions, which are adapted to control microtubule length.},

@article{Skibbens1995,
abstract = {During mitosis in vertebrate somatic cells, the single attached kinetochore on a mono-oriented chromosome exhibits directional instability: abruptly and independently switching between constant velocity poleward and away from the pole motility states. When the non-attached sister becomes attached to the spindle (chromosome bi-orientation), the motility of the sister kinetochores becomes highly coordinated, one moving poleward while the other moves away from the pole, allowing chromosomes to congress to the spindle equator. In our kinetochore-tensiometer model, we hypothesized that this coordinated behavior is regulated by tension across the centromere produced by kinetochore movement relative to the sister kinetochore and bulk of the chromosome arms. To test this model, we severed or severely weakened the centromeric chromatin between sister kinetochores on bi-oriented newt lung cell chromosomes with a laser microbeam. This procedure converted a pair of tightly linked sister kinetochores into two mono-oriented single kinetochore-chromatin fragments that were tethered to their chromosome arms by thin compliant chromatin strands. These single kinetochore-chromatin fragments moved substantial distances off the metaphase plate, stretching their chromatin strands, before the durations of poleward and away from the pole movement again became similar. In contrast, the severed arms remained at or moved closer to the spindle equator. The poleward and away from the pole velocities of single kinetochore-chromatin fragments in prometaphase were typical of velocities exhibited by sister kinetochores on intact chromosomes from prometaphase through midanaphase A. However, severing the chromatin between sister kinetochores uncoupled the normally coordinated motility of sister kinetochores. Laser ablation also uncoupled the motilities of the single kinetochore fragments from the bulk of the arms. These results reveal that kinetochore directional instability is a fundamental property of the kinetochore and that the motilities of sister kinetochores are coordinated during congression by a stiff centromere linkage. We conclude that kinetochores act as tensiometers that sense centromere tension generated by differential movement of sister kinetochores and their chromosome arms to control switching between constant velocity P and AP motility states.},

abstract = {Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells can switch between two mating types, plus (P) and minus (M). The change in cell type occurs due to a replication-coupled recombination event that transfers genetic information from one of the silent-donor loci, mat2P or mat3M, into the expressed mating-type determining mat1 locus. The mat1 locus can as a consequence contain DNA encoding either P or M information. A molecular mechanism, known as synthesis-dependent strand annealing, has been proposed for the underlying recombination event. A key feature of this model is that only one DNA strand of the donor locus provides the information that is copied into the mat1. Here we test the model by constructing strains that switch using two different mutant P cassettes introduced at the donor loci, mat2 and mat3. We show that in such strains wild-type P-cassette DNA is efficiently generated at mat1 through heteroduplex DNA formation and repair. The present data provide an in vivo genetic test of the proposed molecular recombination mechanism.},

@article{Maddox2003,
abstract = {Microtubule plus ends dynamically attach to kinetochores on mitotic chromosomes. We directly imaged this dynamic interface using high resolution fluorescent speckle microscopy and direct labeling of kinetochores in Xenopus extract spindles. During metaphase, kinetochores were stationary and under tension while plus end polymerization and poleward microtubule flux (flux) occurred at velocities varying from 1.5-2.5 micro m/min. Because kinetochore microtubules polymerize at metaphase kinetochores, the primary source of kinetochore tension must be the spindle forces that produce flux and not a kinetochore-based mechanism. We infer that the kinetochore resists translocation of kinetochore microtubules through their attachment sites, and that the polymerization state of the kinetochore acts a "slip-clutch" mechanism that prevents detachment at high tension. At anaphase onset, kinetochores switched to depolymerization of microtubule plus ends, resulting in chromosome-to-pole rates transiently greater than flux. Kinetochores switched from persistent depolymerization to persistent polymerization and back again during anaphase, bistability exhibited by kinetochores in vertebrate tissue cells. These results provide the most complete description of spindle microtubule poleward flux to date, with important implications for the microtubule-kinetochore interface and for how flux regulates kinetochore function.},

abstract = {The impact of mechanical forces on kinetochore motility was investigated using laser microsurgery to detach kinetochores with associated chromatin (K fragment) from meiotic chromosomes in spermatocytes from the crane fly Nephrotoma suturalis. In spermatocytes, elastic tethers connect telomeres of homologues during anaphase A of meiosis I, thus preventing complete disjunction until mid- to late anaphase A. K fragments liberated from tethered arms moved at twice the normal velocity toward their connected poles. To assess functional states of detached and control kinetochores, we loaded cells with fluorescently labeled tubulin for fluorescent speckle microscopy on kinetochore microtubules. Control kinetochores added fluorescent speckles at the kinetochore during anaphase A, whereas kinetochores of K fragments generally did not. In cases in which speckles reappeared in K-fragment K fibers, speckles and K fragments moved poleward at similar velocities. Thus detached kinetochores convert from their normal polymerization (reverse pac-man) state to a different state, in which polymerization is not evident. We suggest that the converted state is "park," in which kinetochores are anchored to plus ends of kinetochore microtubules that shorten exclusively at their polar ends.},

abstract = {Aurora-B is the kinase subunit of the Chromosome Passenger Complex (CPC), a key regulator of mitotic progression that corrects improper kinetochore attachments and establishes the spindle midzone. Recent work has demonstrated that the CPC is a microtubule-associated protein complex and that microtubules are able to activate the CPC by contributing to Aurora-B auto-phosphorylation in trans. Aurora-B activation is thought to occur when the local concentration of Aurora-B is high, as occurs when Aurora-B is enriched at centromeres. It is not clear, however, whether distributed binding to large structures such as microtubules would increase the local concentration of Aurora-B. Here we show that microtubules accelerate the kinase activity of Aurora-B by a "reduction in dimensionality." We find that microtubules increase the kinase activity of Aurora-B toward microtubule-associated substrates while reducing the phosphorylation levels of substrates not associated to microtubules. Using the single molecule assay for microtubule-associated proteins, we show that a minimal CPC construct binds to microtubules and diffuses in a one-dimensional (1D) random walk. The binding of Aurora-B to microtubules is salt-dependent and requires the C-terminal tails of tubulin, indicating that the interaction is electrostatic. We show that the rate of Aurora-B auto-activation is faster with increasing concentrations of microtubules. Finally, we demonstrate that microtubules lose their ability to stimulate Aurora-B when their C-terminal tails are removed by proteolysis. We propose a model in which microtubules act as scaffolds for the enzymatic activity of Aurora-B. The scaffolding activity of microtubules enables rapid Aurora-B activation and efficient phosphorylation of microtubule-associated substrates.},

@article{Oliveira2010,
abstract = {The metaphase-anaphase transition is orchestrated through proteolysis of numerous proteins by a ubiquitin protein ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C). A crucial aspect of this process is sister chromatid separation, which is thought to be mediated by separase, a thiol protease activated by the APC/C. Separase cleaves cohesin, a ring-shaped complex that entraps sister DNAs. It is a matter of debate whether cohesin-independent forces also contribute to sister chromatid cohesion. Using 4D live-cell imaging of Drosophila melanogaster syncytial embryos blocked in metaphase (via APC/C inhibition), we show that artificial cohesin cleavage is sufficient to trigger chromosome disjunction. This is nevertheless insufficient for correct chromosome segregation. Kinetochore-microtubule attachments are rapidly destabilized by the loss of tension caused by cohesin cleavage in the presence of high Cdk1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) activity, as occurs when the APC/C cannot destroy mitotic cyclins. Metaphase chromosomes undergo a bona fide anaphase when cohesin cleavage is combined with Cdk1 inhibition. We conclude that only two key events, opening of cohesin rings and downregulation of Cdk1, are sufficient to drive proper segregation of chromosomes in anaphase.},

abstract = {Background: The pole-to-pole distance of the metaphase spindle is reasonably constant in a given cell type; in the case of vertebrate female oocytes, this steady-state length can be maintained for substantial lengths of time, during which time microtubules remain highly dynamic. Although a number of molecular perturbations have been shown to influence spindle length, a global understanding of the factors that determine metaphase spindle length has not been achieved. Results: Using the Drosophila S2 cell line, we depleted or overexpressed proteins that either generate sliding forces between spindle microtubules (Kinesin-5, Kinesin-14, dynein), promote microtubule polymerization (EB1, Mast/Orbit [CLASP], Minispindles [Dis1/XMAP215/TOG]) or depolymerization (Kinesin-8, Kinesin-13), or mediate sister-chromatid cohesion (Rad21) in order to explore how these forces influence spindle length. Using high-throughput automated microscopy and semiautomated image analyses of >4000 spindles, we found a reduction in spindle size after RNAi of microtubule-polymerizing factors or overexpression of Kinesin-8, whereas longer spindles resulted from the knockdown of Rad21, Kinesin-8, or Kinesin-13. In contrast, and differing from previous reports, bipolar spindle length is relatively insensitive to increases in motor-generated sliding forces. However, an ultrasensitive monopolar-to-bipolar transition in spindle architecture was observed at a critical concentration of the Kinesin-5 sliding motor. These observations could be explained by a quantitative model that proposes a coupling between microtubule depolymerization rates and microtubule sliding forces. Conclusions: By integrating extensive RNAi with high-throughput image-processing methodology and mathematical modeling, we reach to a conclusion that metaphase spindle length is sensitive to alterations in microtubule dynamics and sister-chromatid cohesion, but robust against alterations of microtubule sliding force. ©2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {During cell division, a mitotic spindle is built by the cell and acts to align and stretch duplicated sister chromosomes before their ultimate segregation into daughter cells. Stretching of the pericentromeric chromatin during metaphase is thought to generate a tension-based signal that promotes proper chromosome segregation. However, it is not known whether the mitotic spindle actively maintains a set point tension magnitude for properly attached sister chromosomes to facilitate robust mechanochemical checkpoint signaling. By imaging and tracking the thermal movements of pericentromeric fluorescent markers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we measured pericentromere stiffness and then used the stiffness measurements to quantitatively evaluate the tension generated by pericentromere stretch during metaphase in wild-type cells and in mutants with disrupted chromosome structure. We found that pericentromere tension in yeast is substantial (4-6 pN) and is tightly self-regulated by the mitotic spindle: through adjustments in spindle structure, the cell maintains wild-type tension magnitudes even when pericentromere stiffness is disrupted.},

Recent studies have shown that cooperative interactions also function during the formation of a complex cellular structure, the mitotic spindle. Capture of kinetochores by dynamic astral microtubules was originally proposed as the basis of spindle formation. However, mounting evidence indicates that a more complex series of events occurs. It is now clear that there are multiple microtubule nucleation and capture sites throughout the spindle. Kinetochores, centrosomes and microtubules play multiple roles in establishing connections between spindle components and integrating them into a common structure. These data support a modified search-and-capture model that incorporates additional assembly pathways coordinated by a RanGTP gradient.},

abstract = {Accurate segregation of the replicated genome requires chromosome biorientation on the spindle. Biorientation is ensured by Aurora B kinase, a member of the 4-subunit chromosomal passenger complex (CPC)1,2. Localization of the CPC to the inner centromere is central to the current model for how tension ensures chromosome biorientation—kinetochore-spindle attachments not under tension remain close to the inner centromere and are destabilized by Aurora B phosphorylation, whereas kinetochores under tension are pulled away from the influence of Aurora B, stabilizing their microtubule attachments3–5. Here we show that an engineered truncation of the INCENP/ Sli15 subunit of budding yeast CPC that eliminates association with the inner centromere nevertheless supports proper chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis. Truncated INCENP/Sli15 suppresses the deletion phenotypes of the inner centromere-targeting proteins Survivin/Bir1, Borealin/Nbl1, Bub1 and Sgo16. Unlike wildtype INCENP/Sli15, truncated INCENP/Sli15 localizes to pre-anaphase spindle microtubules. Premature targeting of full-length INCENP/Sli15 to microtubules by preventing Cdk1 phosphorylation also suppresses inviability of Survivin/Bir1 deletion. These results suggest that activation of Aurora B/Ipl1 by clustering either on chromatin or on microtubules is sufficient for chromosome biorientation.},

abstract = {During mitosis, sister chromatids congress to the spindle equator and are subsequently segregated via attachment to dynamic kinetochore microtubule (kMT) plus ends. A major question is how kMT plus-end assembly is spatially regulated to achieve chromosome congression. Here we find in budding yeast that the widely conserved kinesin-5 sliding motor proteins, Cin8p and Kip1p, mediate chromosome congression by suppressing kMT plus-end assembly of longer kMTs. Of the two, Cin8p is the major effector and its activity requires a functional motor domain. In contrast, the depolymerizing kinesin-8 motor Kip3p plays a minor role in spatial regulation of yeast kMT assembly. Our analysis identified a model where kinesin-5 motors bind to kMTs, move to kMT plus ends, and upon arrival at a growing plus end promote net kMT plus-end disassembly. In conclusion, we find that length-dependent control of net kMT assembly by kinesin-5 motors yields a simple and stable self-organizing mechanism for chromosome congression. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we tracked the motion of yeast (Kip3) and human (Kif18A) kinesin-8s with high precision under varying loads using optical tweezers. Surprisingly, both kinesin-8 motors were much weaker compared with other kinesins. Furthermore, we discovered a force-induced stick-slip motion: the motor frequently slipped, recovered from this state, and then resumed normal stepping motility without detaching from the microtubule. The low forces are consistent with kinesin-8s being regulators of microtubule dynamics rather than cargo transporters. The weakly bound slip state, reminiscent of a molecular safety leash, may be an adaptation for high processivity. © 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Fission yeast has two kinesin-8s, Klp5 and Klp6, which associate to form a heterocomplex. Here, we show that Klp5 and Klp6 are mutually dependent on each other for nuclear mitotic localization. During interphase, they are exported to the cytoplasm. In sharp contrast, during mitosis, Klp5 and Klp6 remain in the nucleus, which requires the existence of each counterpart. Canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS) is identified in the nonkinesin C-terminal regions. Intriguingly individual NLS mutants (NLSmut) exhibit loss-of-function phenotypes, suggesting that Klp5 and Klp6 enter the nucleus separately. Indeed, although neither Klp5-NLSmut nor Klp6-NLSmut enters the nucleus, wild-type Klp6 or Klp5, respectively, does so with different kinetics. In the absence of Klp5/6, microtubule catastrophe/rescue frequency and dynamicity are suppressed, whereas growth and shrinkage rates are least affected. Remarkably, chimera strains containing only the N-terminal Klp5 kinesin domains cannot disassemble interphase microtubules during mitosis, leading to the coexistence of cytoplasmic microtubules and nuclear spindles with massive chromosome missegregation. In this strain, a marked reduction of microtubule dynamism, even higher than in klp5/6 deletions, is evident. We propose that Klp5 and Klp6 play a vital role in promoting microtubule dynamics, which is essential for the spatiotemporal control of microtubule morphogenesis.},

abstract = {The mitotic spindle assembles into a bipolar, microtubule-based protein machine during prometaphase. One proposed mechanism for this process is "search-and-capture," in which dynamically unstable microtubules (MTs) search space to capture chromosomes. Although existing theoretical estimates suggest that dynamic instability is efficient enough to allow capture within characteristic mitotic timescales, they are limited in scope and do not address the capture times for realistic numbers of chromosomes. Here we used mathematical modeling to explore this issue. We show that without any bias toward the chromosomes, search-and-capture is not efficient enough to explain the typical observed duration of prometaphase. We further analyze search-and-capture in the presence of a spatial gradient of a stabilizing factor that biases MT dynamics toward the chromosomes. We show theoretically that such biased search-and-capture is efficient enough to account for chromosome capture. We also show that additional factors must contribute to accelerate the spindle assembly for cells with large nuclear volumes. We discuss the possibility that a RanGTP gradient introduces a spatial bias into microtubule dynamics and thus improves the efficiency of search-and-capture as a mechanism for spindle assembly.},

abstract = {The microtubule cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure in which the lengths of the microtubules are tightly regulated. One regulatory mechanism is the depolymerization of microtubules by motor proteins in the kinesin-13 family. These proteins are crucial for the control of microtubule length in cell division, neuronal development and interphase microtubule dynamics. The mechanism by which kinesin-13 proteins depolymerize microtubules is poorly understood. A central question is how these proteins target to microtubule ends at rates exceeding those of standard enzyme-substrate kinetics. To address this question we developed a single-molecule microscopy assay for MCAK, the founding member of the kinesin-13 family. Here we show that MCAK moves along the microtubule lattice in a one-dimensional (1D) random walk. MCAK-microtubule interactions were transient: the average MCAK molecule diffused for 0.83 s with a diffusion coefficient of 0.38 microm2 s(-1). Although the catalytic depolymerization by MCAK requires the hydrolysis of ATP, we found that the diffusion did not. The transient transition from three-dimensional diffusion to 1D diffusion corresponds to a "reduction in dimensionality" that has been proposed as the search strategy by which DNA enzymes find specific binding sites. We show that MCAK uses this strategy to target to both microtubule ends more rapidly than direct binding from solution.},

They are thought to contain both active, force-producing and passive, frictional interfaces with microtubules whose relative locations have been unclear. We inferred mechanical deformation within single kinetochores during metaphase oscillations by measuring average separations between fluorescently labeled kinetochore subunits in living cells undergoing mitosis. Inter-subunit distances were shorter in kinetochores moving toward poles than in those moving away. Inter-subunit separation decreased abruptly when kinetochores switched to poleward movement and decreased further when pulling force increased, suggesting that active force generation during poleward movement compresses kinetochores. The data revealed an active force-generating interface within kinetochores and a separate passive frictional interface located at least 20 nanometers away poleward. Together, these interfaces allow persistent attachment with intermittent active force generation.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Kinetochores of mitotic chromosomes are coupled to spindle microtubules in ways that allow the energy from tubulin dynamics to drive chromosome motion. Most kinetochore-associated microtubule ends display curving "protofilaments," strands of tubulin dimers that bend away from the microtubule axis. Both a kinetochore "plate" and an encircling, ring-shaped protein complex have been proposed to link protofilament bending to poleward chromosome motion. Here we show by electron tomography that slender fibrils connect curved protofilaments directly to the inner kinetochore. Fibril-protofilament associations correlate with a local straightening of the flared protofilaments. Theoretical analysis reveals that protofilament-fibril connections would be efficient couplers for chromosome motion, and experimental work on two very different kinetochore components suggests that filamentous proteins can couple shortening microtubules to cargo movements. These analyses define a ring-independent mechanism for harnessing microtubule dynamics directly to chromosome movement. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, proper formation of the spindle is necessary for successful cell division. We have studied chromosome recapture in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show by live cell analysis that lost kinetochores interact laterally with intranuclear microtubules (INMs) and that both microtubule depolymerization (end-on pulling) and minus-end-directed movement (microtubule sliding) contribute to chromosome retrieval to the spindle pole body (SPB). We find that the minus-end-directed motor Klp2 colocalizes with the kinetochore during its transport to the SPB and contributes to the effectiveness of retrieval by affecting both end-on pulling and lateral sliding. Furthermore, we provide in vivo evidence that Dam1, a component of the DASH complex, also colocalizes with the kinetochore during its transport and is essential for its retrieval by either of these mechanisms. Finally, we find that the position of the unattached kinetochore correlates with the size and orientation of the INMs, suggesting that chromosome recapture may not be a random process.},

Duo1p was localized by immunofluorescence, by immunoelectron microscopy, and by tagging with green fluorescent protein (GFP), to intranuclear spindle microtubules and spindle pole bodies. Temperature-sensitive duo1 mutants arrest with short spindles. This arrest is dependent on the mitotic checkpoint. Dam1p was identified by two-hybrid analysis as a protein that binds to Duo1p. By expressing a  GFP-Dam1p fusion protein in yeast, Dam1p was also shown to be associated with intranuclear spindle microtubules and spindle pole bodies in vivo. As with Duo1p, overproduction of Dam1p caused mitotic defects. Biochemical experiments demonstrated that Dam1p binds directly to microtubules with micromolar affinity. We suggest that Dam1p might localize Duo1p to intranuclear microtubules and spindle pole bodies to provide a previously unrecognized function (or functions) required for mitosis.},

To identify proteins that play a corresponding role at the vertebrate kinetochore-microtubule interface, we isolated a three subunit human Ska1 complex, including the previously uncharacterized protein Rama1 that localizes to the outer kinetochore and spindle microtubules. Depletion of Ska1 complex subunits severely compromises proper chromosome segregation. Reconstituted Ska1 complex possesses two separable biochemical activities: direct microtubule binding through the Ska1 subunit, and microtubule-stimulated oligomerization imparted by the Rama1 subunit. The full Ska1 complex forms assemblies on microtubules that can facilitate the processive movement of microspheres along depolymerizing microtubules.

Here, we combine the use of force-calibrated needles, high-resolution microscopy, and biochemical perturbations to analyze the vertebrate metaphase spindle's timescale- and orientation-dependent viscoelastic properties. We find that spindle viscosity depends on microtubule crosslinking and density. Spindle elasticity can be linked to kinetochore and nonkinetochore microtubule rigidity, and also to spindle pole organization by kinesin-5 and dynein. These data suggest a quantitative model for the micromechanics of this cytoskeletal architecture and provide insight into how structural and functional stability is maintained in the face of forces, such as those that control spindle size and position, and can result from deformations associated with chromosome movement.},

abstract = {Kinetochores are the central force-generating machines that move chromosomes during cell division. It is generally assumed that kinetochores move in an autonomous manner. However, we reveal here that movements of neighboring sister-kinetochore pairs in metaphase are correlated in a distance-dependent manner. This correlation increases in the absence ofkinetochore oscillations or stable end-on attachments. This suggests that periodic movements of bioriented chromosomes limit the correlated motion of nonsisters. Computer simulations show that these correlated movements can occur when elastic crosslinks are placed between the K-fibers of oscillating kinetochores. Strikingly, inhibition of the microtubule crosslinking motor kinesin-5 Eg5 leads to an increase in nonsister correlation and impairs periodic oscillations. These phenotypes are partially rescued by codepletion of the kinesin-12 Kif15, demonstrating a function for kinesin-5 and kinesin-12 motors in driving chromosome movements, possibly as part of a crosslinking structure that correlates the movements of nonsister kinetochores. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

But how does this cell division occur? How is it regulated? And what are the consequences when regulation fails? The Cell Cycle: Principles of Control provides an engaging insight into the process of cell division, bringing to the student a much-needed synthesis of a subject entering a period of unprecedented growth as an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cell division are revealed. The book gives the student a complete overview of the process of cell division - from chromosome division, through mitosis, cytokinesis, and meiosis - before exploring how cell proliferation is controlled, and how the cell cycle responds to DNA damage. Finally, the book examines the intrinsic relationship between the cell cycle and cancer, and how a detailed understanding of the cell cycle may lead to new specific therapies to treat the disease. The Cell Cycle combines articulate prose with striking full colour illustrations, while the unique Primers in Biology modular structure integrates text, illustrations, definitions, and literature references for each topic into one double-page spread, bringing to the student's fingertips all the tools that they need to master that topic. An understanding of the cell cycle is a central tool in gaining insights into many biological systems and processes. The Cell Cycle: Principles of Control is the ideal resource for any student wishing to develop a sound grasp of this vitally important subject.

abstract = {The cytoskeleton is essential for the maintenance of cell morphology in eukaryotes. In fission yeast, for example, polarized growth sites are organized by actin, whereas microtubules (MTs) acting upstream control where growth occurs. Growth is limited to the cell poles when MTs undergo catastrophes there and not elsewhere on the cortex. Here, we report that the modulation of MT dynamics by forces as observed in vitro can quantitatively explain the localization of MT catastrophes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. However, we found that it is necessary to add length-dependent catastrophe rates to make the model fully consistent with other previously measured traits of MTs. We explain the measured statistical distribution of MT-cortex contact times and re-examine the curling behavior of MTs in unbranched straight tea1Delta cells. Importantly, the model demonstrates that MTs together with associated proteins such as depolymerizing kinesins are, in principle, sufficient to mark the cell poles.},

abstract = {Kinetochores are multi-protein machines that control chromosome movements by regulating the dynamics of attached microtubules. In human cells chromosome movements are orchestrated by the leading kinetochore tracking a shrinking microtubule whilst its sister tracks a growing microtubule. Directional switches occur when (both) kinetochore-attached microtubules fl ip between these two states, adaptive and coordinated switching then giving rise to the oscillations observed during metaphase. However the mechanisms (and rules) controlling directional switching are poorly understood. This work demonstrates that by tracking kinetochores with sub-pixel resolution in HeLa cells and fitting stochastic mathematical models that a sensor on the leading sister triggers switching when the tension across the centromeric spring connecting the sisters builds up sufficiently rapidly. Further it is shown that the trailing sisters polymerisation state is stabilised by high spring tension. These mechanisms pre-empt trail-first switching that would otherwise impose abnormal pulling forces between sister chromatids. As a consequence sister-switching is biased towards lead-first switching, switching of the trailing sister rapidly following as the spring tension falls, this removing the force dependent stabilisation of the trailing sisters K-fibre (kinetochore bound microtubules). This model explains how switching events are initiated and resolved, the centromeric spring tension providing a means for inter-sister communication and cross regulation that results in coordinated oscillations within a context of low spring tension. This study demonstrates that high throughput analysis and modelling pipelines can provide novel mechanistic insight into mechanochemical systems.},

abstract = {Motor proteins in the kinesin-8 family depolymerize microtubules in a length-dependent manner that may be crucial for controlling the length of organelles such as the mitotic spindle. We used single-molecule microscopy to understand the mechanism of length-dependent depolymerization by the budding yeast kinesin-8, Kip3p. We found that after binding at a random position on a microtubule and walking to the plus end, an individual Kip3p molecule pauses there until an incoming Kip3p molecule bumps it off. Kip3p dissociation is accompanied by removal of just one or two tubulin dimers (on average). Such a cooperative mechanism leads to a depolymerization rate that is proportional to the flux of motors to the microtubule end and accounts for the length dependence of depolymerization. This type of feedback between length and disassembly may serve as a model for understanding how an ensemble of molecules can measure and control polymer length. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Ska1 and Ska2 form a complex at the kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) interface and are required for timely progression from metaphase to anaphase. Here, we use mass spectrometry to search for additional components of the Ska complex. We identify C13Orf3 (now termed Ska3) as a novel member of this complex and map the interaction domains among the three known components. Ska3 displays similar characteristics as Ska1 and Ska2: it localizes to the spindle and KT throughout mitosis and its depletion markedly delays anaphase transition. Interestingly, a more complete removal of the Ska complex by concomitant depletion of Ska1 and Ska3 results in a chromosome congression failure followed by cell death. This severe phenotype reflects a destabilization of KT-MT interactions, as demonstrated by reduced cold stability of KT fibres. Yet, the depletion of the Ska complex only marginally impairs KT localization of the KMN network responsible for MT attachment. We propose that the Ska complex functionally complements the KMN, providing an additional layer of stability to KT-MT attachment and possibly signalling completion of attachment to the spindle checkpoint.},

abstract = {Neurons, like all cells, face the problem that tubulin forms microtubules with too many or too few protofilaments (pfs). Cells overcome this heterogeneity with the ??-tubulin ring complex, which provides a nucleation template for 13-pf microtubules. Doublecortin (DCX), a protein that stabilizes microtubules in developing neurons, also nucleates 13-pf microtubules in vitro. Using fluorescence microscopy assays, we show that the binding of DCX to microtubules is optimized for the lateral curvature of the 13-pf lattice. This sensitivity depends on a cooperative interaction wherein DCX molecules decrease the dissociation rate of their neighbors. Mutations in DCX found in patients with subcortical band heterotopia weaken these cooperative interactions. Using assays with dynamic microtubules, we discovered that DCX binds to polymerization intermediates at growing microtubule ends. These results support a mechanism for stabilizing 13-pf microtubules that allows DCX to template new 13-pf microtubules through associations with the sides of the microtubule lattice. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Chromosomes interact through their kinetochores with microtubule plus ends and they are segregated to the spindle poles as the kinetochore microtubules shorten during anaphase A of mitosis. The molecular natures and identities of coupling proteins that allow microtubule depolymerization to pull chromosomes to poles during anaphase have long remained elusive. In budding yeast, the ten-protein Dam1 complex is a critical microtubule-binding component of the kinetochore that oligomerizes into a 50-nm ring around a microtubule in vitro. Here we show, with the use of a real-time, two-colour fluorescence microscopy assay, that the ring complex moves processively for several micrometres at the ends of depolymerizing microtubules without detaching from the lattice. Electron microscopic analysis of 'end-on views' revealed a 16-fold symmetry of the kinetochore rings. This out-of-register arrangement with respect to the 13-fold microtubule symmetry is consistent with a sliding mechanism based on an electrostatically coupled ring-microtubule interface. The Dam1 ring complex is a molecular device that can translate the force generated by microtubule depolymerization into movement along the lattice to facilitate chromosome segregation.},

Motor dynamics are modeled using a jump-diffusion process that incorporates biased diffusion due to the binding of microtubules (MTs) by Kt binder elements and thermal ratchet forces that arise when the polymer grows against the Kt plate. The resulting force-velocity relationships are nonlinear and depend on the strength of MT binding at Kts, as well as the spatial distribution of binders and of MT rate-altering enzymes inside the Kt. In the case when Kt binders are weakly bound and spaced with the same period as the MT binding sites, the numerical results for the motor force-velocity relation and breaking loads are in complete agreement with our approximate analytic solutions. We show that in this limit motor velocity depends directly on the balance of polymer tip polymerization/depolymerization rates and is fairly insensitive to load variations. In the strong binding...},

abstract = {During meiosis, telomeres cluster and promote homologous chromosome pairing. Telomere clustering requires the interaction of telomeres with the nuclear membrane proteins SUN (Sad1/UNC-84) and KASH (Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne homology). The mechanism by which telomeres gather remains elusive. In this paper, we show that telomere clustering in fission yeast depends on microtubules and the microtubule motors, cytoplasmic dynein, and kinesins. Furthermore, the $\gamma$-tubulin complex ($\gamma$-TuC) is recruited to SUN- and KASH-localized telomeres to form a novel microtubule-organizing center that we termed the "telocentrosome." Telocentrosome formation depends on the $\gamma$-TuC regulator Mto1 and on the KASH protein Kms1, and depletion of either Mto1 or Kms1 caused severe telomere clustering defects. In addition, the dynein light chain (DLC) contributes to telocentrosome formation, and simultaneous depletion of DLC and dynein also caused severe clustering defects. Thus, the telocentrosome is essential for telomere clustering. We propose that telomere-localized SUN and KASH induce telocentrosome formation and that subsequent microtubule motor-dependent aggregation of telocentrosomes via the telocentrosome-nucleated microtubules causes telomere clustering.},

abstract = {During mitosis in most eukaryotic cells, chromosomes align and form a metaphase plate halfway between the spindle poles, about which they exhibit oscillatory movement. These movements are accompanied by changes in the distance between sister kinetochores, commonly referred to as breathing. We developed a live cell imaging assay combined with computational image analysis to quantify the properties and dynamics of sister kinetochores in three dimensions. We show that baseline oscillation and breathing speeds in late prometaphase and metaphase are set by microtubule depolymerases, whereas oscillation and breathing periods depend on the stiffness of the mechanical linkage between sisters. Metaphase plates become thinner as cells progress toward anaphase as a result of reduced oscillation speed at a relatively constant oscillation period. The progressive slowdown of oscillation speed and its coupling to plate thickness depend nonlinearly on the stiffness of the mechanical linkage between sisters. We propose that metaphase plate formation and thinning require tight control of the state of the mechanical linkage between sisters mediated by centromeric chromatin and cohesion.},

abstract = {Length regulation of microtubules (MTs) is essential for many cellular processes. Molecular motors like kinesin-8, which move along MTs and also act as depolymerases, are known as key players in MT dynamics. However, the regulatory mechanisms of length control remain elusive. Here, we investigate a stochastic model accounting for the interplay between polymerization kinetics and motor-induced depolymerization. We determine the dependence of MT length and variance on rate constants and motor concentration. Moreover, our analyses reveal how collective phenomena lead to a well-defined MT length.},

abstract = {For accurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division, microtubule fibres must attach sister kinetochores to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle (bi-orientation). Aurora kinases are linked to oncogenesis and have been implicated in the regulation of chromosome-microtubule attachments. Although loss of Aurora kinase activity causes an accumulation of mal-orientated chromosomes in dividing cells, it is not known how the active kinase corrects improper chromosome attachments. The use of reversible small-molecule inhibitors allows activation of protein function in living vertebrate cells with temporal control. Here we show that by removal of small-molecule inhibitors, controlled activation of Aurora kinase during mitosis can correct chromosome attachment errors by selective disassembly of kinetochore-microtubule fibres, rather than by alternative mechanisms involving initial release of microtubules from either kinetochores or spindle poles. Observation of chromosomes and microtubule dynamics with real-time high-resolution microscopy showed that mal-orientated, but not bi-orientated, chromosomes move to the spindle pole as both kinetochore-microtubule fibres shorten, followed by alignment at the metaphase plate. Our results provide direct evidence for a mechanism required for the maintenance of genome integrity during cell division.},

@article{Inoue1967,
abstract = {This article summarizes our current views on the dynamic structure of the mitotic spindle and its relation to mitotic chromosome movements. The following statements are based on measurements of birefringence of spindle fibers in living cells, normally developing or experimentally modified by various physical and chemical agents, including high and low temperatures, antimitotic drugs, heavy water, and ultraviolet microbeam irradiation. Data were also obtained concomitantly with electron microscopy employing a new fixative and through measurements of isolated spindle protein. Spindle fibers in living cells are labile dynamic structures whose constituent filaments (microtubules) undergo cyclic breakdown and reformation. The dynamic state is maintained by an equilibrium between a pool of protein molecules and their linearly aggregated polymers, which constitute the microtubules or filaments. In living cells under physiological conditions, the association of the molecules into polymers is very weak (absolute value of DeltaF(25 degrees C) < 1 kcal), and the equilibrium is readily shifted to dissociation by low temperature or by high hydrostatic pressure. The equilibrium is shifted toward formation of polymer by increase in temperature (with a large increase in entropy: DeltaS(25 degrees C) approximately 100 eu) or by the addition of heavy water. The spindle proteins tend to polymerize with orienting centers as their geometrical foci. The centrioles, kinetochores, and cell plate act as orienting centers successively during mitosis. Filaments are more concentrated adjacent to an orienting center and yield higher birefringence. Astral rays, continuous fibers, chromosomal fibers, and phragmoplast fibers are thus formed by successive reorganization of the same protein molecules. During late prophase and metaphase, polymerization takes place predominantly at the kinetochores; in metaphase and anaphase, depolymerization is prevalent near the spindle poles. When the concentration of spindle protein is high, fusiform bundles of polymer are precipitated out even in the absence of obvious orienting centers. The shift of equilibrium from free protein molecules to polymer increases the length and number of the spindle microtubules or filaments. Slow depolymerization of the polymers, which can be brought about by low concentrations of colchicine or by gradual cooling, allows the filaments to shorten and perform work. The dynamic equilibrium controlled by orienting centers and other factors provides a plasusible mechanism by which chromosomes and other organelles, as well as the cell surface, are deformed or moved by temporarily organized arrays of microtubules or filaments.},

abstract = {The Dam1 complex is a kinetochore component that couples chromosomes to the dynamic ends of kinetochore microtubules (kMTs). Work in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that the Dam1 complex forms a 16-unit ring encircling and tracking the tip of a MT in vitro, consistent with its cellular function as a coupler. Dam1 also forms smaller, nonring patches in vitro that track the dynamic ends of MTs. However, the identity of Dam1's functional form in vivo remains unknown. Here we report a comprehensive in vivo characterization of Dam1 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In addition to their dense localizations on kinetochores and spindle MTs during mitosis, we identify that Dam1 is also localized onto cytoplasmic MTs as discrete spots in interphase, providing the unique opportunity to analyze Dam1 oligomers at the single-particle resolution in live cells. Such analysis shows that each oligomer contains one to five copies of Dam1, and is able to "switch-rail" while moving along MTs, precluding the possibility of a 16-unit encircling structure. Dam1 patches track the plus ends of the shortening, but not the elongating, MTs and retard MT depolymerization. Together with Mal3, the EB1-like MT-interacting protein, cytoplasmic Dam1 plays an important role in maintaining proper cell shape. In mitosis, kinetochore-associated Dam1 appears to facilitate kMT depolymerization. Together, our findings suggest that patches, instead of rings, are the physiologically functional forms of Dam1 in pombe. Our findings help establish the benchmark parameters of the Dam1 coupler and elucidate the mechanism of its functions.},

abstract = {Cdk1 controls many aspects of mitotic chromosome behavior and spindle microtubule (MT) dynamics to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. In this paper, we characterize a new kinetochore substrate of fission yeast Cdk1, Nsk1, which promotes proper kinetochore-MT (k-MT) interactions and chromosome movements in a phosphoregulated manner. Cdk1 phosphorylation of Nsk1 antagonizes Nsk1 kinetochore and spindle localization during early mitosis. A nonphosphorylatable Nsk1 mutant binds prematurely to kinetochores and spindle, cementing improper k-MT attachments and leading to high rates of lagging chromosomes that missegregate. Accordingly, cells lacking nsk1 exhibit synthetic growth defects with mutations that disturb MT dynamics and/or kinetochore structure, and lack of proper phosphoregulation leads to even more severe defects. Intriguingly, Nsk1 is stabilized by binding directly to the dynein light chain Dlc1 independently of the dynein motor, and Nsk1-Dlc1 forms chainlike structures in vitro. Our findings establish new roles for Cdk1 and the Nsk1-Dlc1 complex in regulating the k-MT interface and chromosome segregation.},

abstract = {The mitotic spindle is a macromolecular structure utilized to properly align and segregate sister chromatids to two daughter cells. During mitosis, the spindle maintains a constant length, even though the spindle microtubules (MTs) are constantly undergoing polymerization and depolymerization [1]. Members of the kinesin-8 family are important for the regulation of spindle length and for chromosome positioning [2-9]. Kinesin-8 proteins are length-specific, plus-end-directed motors that are proposed to be either MT depolymerases [3, 4, 8, 10, 11] or MT capping proteins [12]. How Kif18A uses its destabilization activity to control spindle morphology is not known. We found that Kif18A controls spindle length independently of its role in chromosome positioning. The ability of Kif18A to control spindle length is mediated by an ATP-independent MT binding site at the C-terminal end of the Kif18A tail that has a strong affinity for MTs in vitro and in cells. We used computational modeling to ask how modulating the motility or binding properties of Kif18A would affect its activity. Our modeling predicts that both fast motility and a low off rate from the MT end are important for Kif18A function. In addition, our studies provide new insight into how depolymerizing and capping enzymes can lead to MT destabilization. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To investigate the role of microtubules in regulating cell polarity in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we have developed a system in which normally cylindrical fission yeast synchronously form branched cells at high frequency upon treatment with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug thiabendazole (TBZ). Branching depends on both elevated temperature and cell cycle state and occurs at high frequency only when TBZ is added to cells that have not yet passed through New-End Take-Off (NETO), the normal transition from monopolar to bipolar growth. This suggests that microtubules may be of greatest physiological importance for the maintenance of cell shape at specific points in the cell cycle. The localization of three different proteins normally found at cell ends-cortical F-actin, tea1, and an ral3 (scd2)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion-is disrupted by TBZ treatment. However, these proteins can eventually return to cell ends in the absence of microtubules, indicating that although their localization to ends normally depends on microtubules, they may recover by alternative mechanisms. In addition, TBZ induces a shift in ral3-GFP distribution from cell ends to the cell middle, suggesting that a protein complex containing ral3 may be part of the cue that specifies the position of branch formation.},

abstract = {In this research we propose a fast and robust ellipse detection algorithm based on a multipass Hough transform and an image pyramid data structure. The algorithm starts with an exhaustive search on a low-resolution image in the image pyramid using elliptical Hough transform. Then the image resolution is iteratively increased while the candidate ellipses with higher resolution are updated at each step until the original image resolution is reached. After removing the detected ellipses, the Hough transform is repeatedly applied in multiple passes to search for remaining ellipses, and terminates when no more ellipses are found. This approach significantly reduces the false positive error of ellipse detection as compared with the conventional randomized Hough transform method. The analysis shows that the computing complexity of this algorithm is $\Theta$(n(5/2)), and thus the computation time and memory requirement are significantly reduced. The developed algorithm was tested with images containing various numbers of ellipses. The effects of noise-to-signal ratio combined with various ellipse sizes on the detection accuracy were analyzed and discussed. Experimental results revealed that the algorithm is robust to noise. The average detection accuracies were all above 90{\%} for images with less than seven ellipses, and slightly decreased to about 80{\%} for images with more ellipses. The average false positive error was less than 2{\%}.},

abstract = {The spindle checkpoint ensures proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Unravelling checkpoint signalling has been a long-standing challenge owing to the complexity of the structures and forces that regulate chromosome segregation. New reports have now substantially advanced our understanding of checkpoint signalling mechanisms at the kinetochore, the structure that connects microtubules and chromatin. In contrast to the traditional view of a binary checkpoint response - either completely on or off - new findings indicate that the checkpoint response strength is variable. This revised perspective provides insight into how checkpoint bypass can lead to aneuploidy and informs strategies to exploit these errors for cancer treatments.},

This movement depends on K-fibers, spe- cialized microtubule (MT) bundles attached to the chro- mosomes’ kinetochores. A long-standing assumption is that continuous K-fibers connect every kinetochore to a spindle pole and the force for chromosome movement is produced at the kinetochore and coupled with MT depolymerization. However, we found that chromo- somes still maintained their position at the spindle equa- tor during metaphase and segregated properly during anaphase when one of their K-fibers was severed near the kinetochore with a laser microbeam. We also found that, in normal fully assembled spindles, K-fibers of some chromosomes did not extend to the spindle pole. These K-fibers connected to adjacent K-fibers and/or nonkinet- ochore MTs. Poleward movement of chromosomes with short K-fibers was uncoupled from MT depolymerization at the kinetochore. Instead, these chromosomes moved by dynein-mediated transport of the entire K-fiber/ kinetochore assembly. Thus, at least two distinct parallel mechanisms drive chromosome segregation in mamma- lian cells.},

abstract = {Chromosome biorientation, where sister kinetochores attach to microtubules (MTs) from opposing spindle poles, is the configuration that best ensures equal partitioning of the genome during cell division. Erroneous kinetochore-MT attachments are commonplace but are often corrected prior to anaphase [1, 2]. Error correction, thought to be mediated primarily by the centromere-enriched Aurora B kinase (ABK) [3-5], typically occurs near spindle poles [6]; however, the relevance of this locale is unclear. Furthermore, polar ejection forces (PEFs), highest near poles [7], can stabilize improper attachments by pushing mal-oriented chromosome arms away from spindle poles [8, 9]. Hence, there is a conundrum: erroneous kinetochore-MT attachments are weakened where PEFs are most likely to strengthen them. Here, we report that Aurora A kinase (AAK) opposes the stabilizing effect of PEFs. AAK activity contributes to phosphorylation of kinetochore substrates near poles and its inhibition results in chromosome misalignment and an increased incidence of erroneous kinetochore-MT attachments. Furthermore, AAK directly phosphorylates a site in the N-terminal tail of Ndc80/Hec1 that has been implicated in reducing the affinity of the Ndc80 complex for MTs when phosphorylated [10-12]. We propose that an AAK activity gradient contributes to correcting mal-oriented kinetochore-MT attachments in the vicinity of spindle poles.},

abstract = {Using green fluorescent protein probes and rapid acquisition of high-resolution fluorescence images, sister centromeres in budding yeast are found to be separated and oscillate between spindle poles before anaphase B spindle elongation. The rates of movement during these oscillations are similar to those of microtubule plus end dynamics. The degree of preanaphase separation varies widely, with infrequent centromere reassociations observed before anaphase. Centromeres are in a metaphase-like conformation, whereas chromosome arms are neither aligned nor separated before anaphase. Upon spindle elongation, centromere to pole movement (anaphase A) was synchronous for all centromeres and occurred coincident with or immediately after spindle pole separation (anaphase B). Chromatin proximal to the centromere is stretched poleward before and during anaphase onset. The stretched chromatin was observed to segregate to the spindle pole bodies at rates greater than centromere to pole movement, indicative of rapid elastic recoil between the chromosome arm and the centromere. These results indicate that the elastic properties of DNA play an as of yet undiscovered role in the poleward movement of chromosome arms.},

A recombinant plasmid pool containing the entire yeast genome was constructed by partial digestion of yeast DNA with the four-base recognition restriction endonuclease Sau3A to give the equivalent of random fragments, size selection on sucrose gradients, and introduction of the fragments into the yeast vector YRp7 by use of the homology of Sau3A ends with those generated in the vector by cleavage with BamHI. Recombinant plasmids capable of complementing cdc28 mutations were isolated by transformation of a cdc28ts strain and selection for clones capable of growth at the restrictive temperature. Plasmids responsible for complementing the cdc28ts phenotype were shown to recombine specifically with the chromosomal cdc28 locus, confirming the identity of the cloned sequences. In addition, one of the recombinant plasmids was capable of complementing a mutation in tyr1, a gene genetically linked to cdc28. This method of gene isolation and identification should be applicable to all yeast genes for which there are readily scorable mutants.},

@article{Pecreaux2006a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asymmetric division of the C. elegans zygote is due to the posterior-directed movement of the mitotic spindle during metaphase and anaphase. During this movement along the anterior-posterior axis, the spindle oscillates transversely. These motions are thought to be driven by a force-generating complex-possibly containing the motor protein cytoplasmic dynein-that is located at the cell cortex and pulls on microtubules growing out from the spindle poles. A theoretical analysis indicates that the oscillations might arise from mechanical coordination of the force-generating motors, and this coordination is mediated by the load dependence of the motors' detachment from the microtubules. The model predicts that the motor activity must exceed a threshold for oscillations to occur.

RESULTS: We have tested the existence of a threshold by using RNA interference to gradually reduce the levels of dynein light intermediate chain as well as GPR-1 and GPR-2 that are involved in the G protein-mediated regulation of the force generators. We found an abrupt cessation of oscillations as expected if the motor activity dropped below a threshold. Furthermore, we can account for the complex choreography of the mitotic spindle-the precise temporal coordination of the buildup and die-down of the transverse oscillations with the posterior displacement-by a gradual increase in the processivity of a single type of motor machinery during metaphase and anaphase.

CONCLUSIONS: The agreement between our results and modeling suggests that the force generators themselves have the intrinsic capability of generating oscillations when opposing forces exceed a threshold.},

abstract = {We used video-light microscopy and laser microsurgery to test the hypothesis that as a bioriented prometaphase chromosome changes position in PtK1 cells, the kinetochore moving away from its associated pole (AP) exerts a pushing force on the centromere. When we rapidly severed congressing chromosomes near the spindle equator between the sister kinetochores, the kinetochore that was originally "leading" the motion towards a pole (P) always (17/17 cells) continued moving P whereas the "trailing" kinetochore moving AP always stopped moving as soon as the operation was completed. This trailing kinetochore then initiated motion towards the pole it was originally moving away from up to 50 s later. The same result was observed (15/15 cells) when we selectively destroyed the leading (P moving) kinetochore on a congressing chromosome positioned > or = 3 microns from the pole it was moving away from. When we conducted this experiment on congressing chromosomes positioned within 3 microns of the pole, the centromere region either stopped moving, before switching into motion towards the near pole (2/4 cells), or it continued to move AP for 30-44 s (2/4 cells) before switching into P motion. Finally, kinetochore-free chromosome fragments, generated in the polar regions of PtK1 spindles, were ejected AP and often towards the spindle equator at approximately 2 microns/min. From these data we conclude that the kinetochore moving AP on a moving chromosome does not exert a significant pushing force on the chromosome. Instead, our results reveal that, when not generating a P force, kinetochores are in a "neutral" state that allows them to remain stationary or to coast AP in response to external forces sufficient to allow their K-fiber to elongate.},

abstract = {The mitotic spindle checkpoint monitors proper bipolar attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle. Previously, depletion of the novel kinetochore complex Ska1/Ska2 was found to induce a metaphase delay. By using bioinformatics, we identified C13orf3, predicted to associate with kinetochores. Recently, three laboratories independently indentified C13orf3 as an additional Ska complex component, and therefore we adopted the name Ska3. We found that cells depleted of Ska3 by RNAi achieve metaphase alignment but fail to silence the spindle checkpoint or enter anaphase. After hours of metaphase arrest, chromatids separate but retain robust kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Ska3-depleted cells accumulate high levels of the checkpoint protein Bub1 at kinetochores. Ska3 protein accumulation at kinetochores in prometaphase is dependent on Sgo1 protein. Sgo1, which accumulates at the centromeres earlier, in prophase, is not dependent on Ska3. Sgo1-depleted cells show a stronger premature chromatid separation phenotype than those depleted of Ska3. We hypothesize that Ska3 functions to coordinate checkpoint signaling from the microtubule binding sites within a kinetochore by laterally linking the individual binding sites. We suggest that this network plays a major role in silencing the spindle checkpoint when chromosomes are aligned at metaphase to allow timely anaphase onset and mitotic exit.},

This has been possible for microtubule motor teams that transport intracellular organelles, revealing unexpected differences between collective and single-molecule function.

abstract = {Chromosome bi-orientation at the metaphase spindle is essential for precise segregation of the genetic material. The process is error-prone, and error-correction mechanisms exist to switch misaligned chromosomes to the correct, bi-oriented configuration. Here, we analyze several possible dynamical scenarios to explore how cells might achieve correct bi-orientation in an efficient and robust manner. We first illustrate that tension-mediated feedback between the sister kinetochores can give rise to a bistable switch, which allows robust distinction between a loose attachment with low tension and a strong attachment with high tension. However, this mechanism has difficulties in explaining how bi-orientation is initiated starting from unattached kinetochores. We propose four possible mechanisms to overcome this problem (exploiting molecular noise; allowing an efficient attachment of kinetochores already in the absence of tension; a trial-and-error oscillation; and a stochastic bistable switch), and assess their impact on the bi-orientation process. Based on our results and supported by experimental data, we put forward a trial-and-error oscillation and a stochastic bistable switch as two elegant mechanisms with the potential to promote bi-orientation both efficiently and robustly. © 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Proteins from the kinesin-8 family promote microtubule (MT) depolymerization, a process thought to be important for the control of microtubule length in living cells. In addition to this MT shortening activity, kinesin 8s are motors that show plus-end directed motility on MTs. Here we describe a simple model that incorporates directional motion and destabilization of the MT plus-end by kinesin 8. Our model quantitatively reproduces the key features of length-versus-time traces for stabilized MTs in the presence of purified kinesin 8, including length-dependent depolymerization. Comparison of model predictions with experiments suggests that kinesin 8 depolymerizes processively, i.e., one motor can remove multiple tubulin dimers from a stabilized MT. Fluctuations in MT length as a function of time are related to depolymerization processivity. We have also determined the parameter regime in which the rate of MT depolymerization is length dependent: length-dependent depolymerization occurs only when MTs are sufficiently short; this crossover is sensitive to the bulk motor concentration. © 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Identification of proteins that couple kinetochores to spindle microtubules is critical for understanding how accurate chromosome segregation is achieved in mitosis. Here we show that the protein hNuf2 specifically functions at kinetochores for stable microtubule attachment in HeLa cells. When hNuf2 is depleted by RNA interference, spindle formation occurs normally as cells enter mitosis, but kinetochores fail to form their attachments to spindle microtubules and cells block in prometaphase with an active spindle checkpoint. Kinetochores depleted of hNuf2 retain the microtubule motors CENP-E and cytoplasmic dynein, proteins previously implicated in recruiting kinetochore microtubules. Kinetochores also retain detectable levels of the spindle checkpoint proteins Mad2 and BubR1, as expected for activation of the spindle checkpoint by unattached kinetochores. In addition, the cell cycle block produced by hNuf2 depletion induces mitotic cells to undergo cell death. These data highlight a specific role for hNuf2 in kinetochore-microtubule attachment and suggest that hNuf2 is part of a molecular linker between the kinetochore attachment site and tubulin subunits within the lattice of attached plus ends.},

abstract = {Merotelic kinetochore orientation is a misattachment in which a single kinetochore binds microtubules from both spindle poles rather than just one and can produce anaphase lagging chromosomes, a major source of aneuploidy. Merotelic kinetochore orientation occurs frequently in early mitosis, does not block chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate, and is not detected by the spindle checkpoint. However, microtubules to the incorrect pole are usually significantly reduced or eliminated before anaphase. We discovered that the frequency of lagging chromosomes in anaphase is very sensitive to partial inhibition of Aurora kinase activity by ZM447439 at a dose, 3 microM, that has little effect on histone phosphorylation, metaphase chromosome alignment, and cytokinesis in PtK1 cells. Partial Aurora kinase inhibition increased the frequency of merotelic kinetochores in late metaphase, and the fraction of microtubules to the incorrect pole. Measurements of fluorescence dissipation after photoactivation showed that kinetochore-microtubule turnover in prometaphase is substantially suppressed by partial Aurora kinase inhibition. Our results support a preanaphase correction mechanism for merotelic attachments in which correct plus-end attachments are pulled away from high concentrations of Aurora B at the inner centromere, and incorrect merotelic attachments are destabilized by being pulled toward the inner centromere.},

@article{Nicklas1994,
abstract = {The correction of certain errors in mitosis requires capture and release: new kinetochore microtubules must be captured and old, misdirected ones must be released. We studied capture and release in living grasshopper spermatocytes. Capture is remarkably efficient over a broad range in the angle at which a microtubule encounters a kinetochore. However, capture is inefficient when kinetochores point directly away from the source of properly directed microtubules. Capture in that situation is required for correction of the most common error; microtubule-kinetochore encounters are improbable and capture occurs only once every 8 min, on average. Release from the improper attachment caused by misdirected microtubules allows kinetochore movement and the completion of error correction. We tugged on kinetochores with a micromanipulation needle and found they are free to move less than one time in two. Thus error correction depends on two improbable events, capture and release, and they must happen by chance to coincide. In spermatocytes this will occur only once every 18 min, on average, but a leisurely cell cycle provides ample time. Capture and release generate only change, not perfection. Tension from mitotic forces brings change to a halt by stabilizing the one correct attachment of chromosomes to the spindle. We show that tension directly affects stability, rather than merely constraining kinetochore position. This implies that chromosomes are attached to the spindle by tension-sensitive linkers whose stability is necessary for proper chromosome distribution but whose loss is necessary for the correction of errors.},

abstract = {The spindle midzone-composed of antiparallel microtubules, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and motors-is the structure responsible for microtubule organization and sliding during anaphase B. In general, MAPs and motors stabilize the midzone and motors produce sliding. We show that fission yeast kinesin-6 motor klp9p binds to the microtubule antiparallel bundler ase1p at the midzone at anaphase B onset. This interaction depends upon the phosphorylation states of klp9p and ase1p. The cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2p phosphorylates and its antagonist phosphatase clp1p dephosphorylates klp9p and ase1p to control the position and timing of klp9p-ase1p interaction. Failure of klp9p-ase1p binding leads to decreased spindle elongation velocity. The ase1p-mediated recruitment of klp9p to the midzone accelerates pole separation, as suggested by computer simulation. Our findings indicate that a phosphorylation switch controls the spatial-temporal interactions of motors and MAPs for proper anaphase B, and suggest a mechanism whereby a specific motor-MAP conformation enables efficient microtubule sliding.},

abstract = {Quantitative tracking of particle motion using live-cell imaging is a powerful approach to understanding the mechanism of transport of biological molecules, organelles, and cells. However, inferring complex stochastic motion models from single-particle trajectories in an objective manner is nontrivial due to noise from sampling limitations and biological heterogeneity. Here, we present a systematic Bayesian approach to multiple-hypothesis testing of a general set of competing motion models based on particle mean-square displacements that automatically classifies particle motion, properly accounting for sampling limitations and correlated noise while appropriately penalizing model complexity according to Occam's Razor to avoid over-fitting. We test the procedure rigorously using simulated trajectories for which the underlying physical process is known, demonstrating that it chooses the simplest physical model that explains the observed data. Further, we show that computed model probabilities provide a reliability test for the downstream biological interpretation of associated parameter values. We subsequently illustrate the broad utility of the approach by applying it to disparate biological systems including experimental particle trajectories from chromosomes, kinetochores, and membrane receptors undergoing a variety of complex motions. This automated and objective Bayesian framework easily scales to large numbers of particle trajectories, making it ideal for classifying the complex motion of large numbers of single molecules and cells from high-throughput screens, as well as single-cell-, tissue-, and organism-level studies.},

abstract = {Two genes, nda2 and nda3, previously defined by cold sensitive nuclear division arrest (nda) mutations in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe were studied. A mutant nda2-KM52 was found to be supersensitive (at the permissive temperature) to the tubulin-binding drugs such as thiabendazole, methylbenzimidazol-2yl carbamate and nocodazole. A single mutation in nda2 appears to cause both drug supersensitivity and cold sensitivity. The defective phenotypes of nda2-KM52 with a low concentration of the drugs were characterized by nuclear displacement and anomalously situated spindle pole bodies. The allele of the other mutant, nda3-KM311, was sh216 to be linked closely to the ben1 locus, which determines resistance to the drug. The identity of ben1 and nda3 genes was proved by a newly isolated mutant ben1-TB1005; it manifests ben1 resistance and the cold sensitive nda3 phenotype. At 22 degrees C, ben1-TB1005 showed cell branching and deformation characteristic of nda3-KM311. Eleven mutants supersensitive to thiabendazole were newly isolated by replica plating. Four strains were mapped in nda2, while the other four were in nda3. Most of the isolated mutants were blocked at nuclear division in the presence of a low concentration of the drug. Thus, the products of genes nda2 and nda3 (ben1) interact directly or indirectly with the drugs and control, in different ways, microtubular organization in the cells of S. pombe.},

abstract = {The cytoskeleton is regulated by a plethora of enzymes that influence the stability and dynamics of cytoskeletal filaments. Molecular motors of the kinesin-8 protein family depolymerise microtubules in a length-dependent manner, and experimental and theoretical evidence suggest a role for kinesin-8 in the dynamic regulation of microtubules. However, so far the detailed molecular mechanisms how these molecular motors interact with the growing microtubule tip remain elusive. Here we investigate two interaction scenarios for kinesin-8 and the microtubule tip. We give a comprehensive analysis of regimes where length-regulation is possible and characterise how the stationary length depends on the biochemical rates and the bulk concentrations of the various proteins. For a neutral scenario, where microtubules grow irrespective of whether the microtubule tip is occupied by a molecular motor, length regulation is possible only for a narrow range of biochemical rates and limited to small polymerisation rates. In contrast, for an inhibition scenario, where the presence of a motor at the microtubule tip inhibits microtubule growth, the regime of length regulation is extremely broad and includes high growth rates. These results also apply to situations where polymerising enzymes, like XMAP215, and kinesin-8 mutually exclude each other from the microtubule tip. We also investigate the stochastic dynamics of the two scenarios. While for the neutral scenario length is tightly controlled, length dynamics is intermittent for the inhibition scenario and exhibits extended periods of microtubule growth and shrinkage, reminiscent of microtubule dynamic instability. On a broader perspective, the set of models established in this work quite generally suggests that mutual exclusion of molecules at the ends of cytoskeletal filaments is an important factor for filament dynamics and regulation.},

abstract = {In fission yeast, erroneous attachments of spindle microtubules to kinetochores are frequent in early mitosis. Most are corrected before anaphase onset by a mechanism involving the protein kinase Aurora B, which destabilizes kinetochore microtubules (ktMTs) in the absence of tension between sister chromatids. In this paper, we describe a minimal mathematical model of fission yeast chromosome segregation based on the stochastic attachment and detachment of ktMTs. The model accurately reproduces the timing of correct chromosome biorientation and segregation seen in fission yeast. Prevention of attachment defects requires both appropriate kinetochore orientation and an Aurora B-like activity. The model also reproduces abnormal chromosome segregation behavior (caused by, for example, inhibition of Aurora B). It predicts that, in metaphase, merotelic attachment is prevented by a kinetochore orientation effect and corrected by an Aurora B-like activity, whereas in anaphase, it is corrected through unbalanced forces applied to the kinetochore. These unbalanced forces are sufficient to prevent aneuploidy.},

It plays a major role in coupling force generation to microtubule plus-end polymerization and depolymerization. In this review, we discuss current theoretical mechanisms of force generation, and then focus on emerging information about mechanistic contributions from the Ndc80 complex in eukaryotes and the microtubule-binding Dam1/DASH complex from fungi. New information has also become available from super-resolution light microscopy on the protein architecture of the kinetochore-microtubule attachment site in both budding yeast and humans, which provides further insight into the mechanism of force generation. We briefly discuss potential contributions of motors, other microtubule-associated proteins, and microtubule depolymerases.

The yeast kinesin-8, Kip3, has been well studied in vitro but a role in chromosome congression has not beenreported. We investigated Kip3's role in this process using semi-automated, quantitative fluorescence microscopy and time-lapse imaging and found that Kip3 is required for congression. Deletion of KIP3 increases inter-kinetochore distances and increases the variability in the position of sister kinetochores along the spindle axis during metaphase. Kip3 does not regulate spindle length and is not required for kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Instead, Kip3 clusters kinetochores on the metaphase spindle by tightly regulating kinetochore microtubule lengths.},

abstract = {The microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton supports a broad range of cellular functions, from providing tracks for intracellular transport, to supporting movement of cilia and flagella, to segregating chromosomes in mitosis. These functions are facilitated by the organizational and dynamic plasticity of MT networks. An important class of enzymes that alters MT dynamics is the depolymerizing kinesin-like proteins, which use their catalytic activities to regulate MT end dynamics. In this review, we discuss four topics surrounding these MT-depolymerizing kinesins. We provide a historical overview of studies focused on these motors and discuss their phylogeny. In the second half, we discuss their enzymology and biophysics and give an overview of their known cellular functions. This discussion highlights the fact that MT-depolymerizing kinesins exhibit a diverse range of design principles, which in turn increases their functional versatility in cells. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology Volume 29 is October 06, 2013.

abstract = {Upon congression at the spindle equator, vertebrate chromosomes display oscillatory movements which typically decline as cells progress towards anaphase. Kinesin-8 Kif18A has been identified as a suppressor of chromosome movements, but how its activity is temporally regulated to dampen chromosome oscillations before anaphase onset remained mysterious. Here, we identify a regulatory network composed of cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (Cdk1) and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) that antagonistically regulate Kif18A. Cdk1-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of Kif18A promotes chromosome oscillations in early metaphase. PP1 induces metaphase plate thinning by directly dephosphorylating Kif18A. Chromosome attachment induces Cdk1 inactivation and kinetochore recruitment of PP1$\alpha$/$\gamma$. Thus, we propose that chromosome biorientation mediates the alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate by tipping the balance in favour of dephosphorylated Kif18A capable of suppressing the oscillatory movements of chromosomes. Notably, interfering with chromosome oscillations severely impairs the fidelity of sister chromatid segregation demonstrating the importance of timely controlled chromosome dynamics for the maintenance of genome integrity.},

abstract = {Spindle microtubules interact with mitotic chromosomes, binding to their kinetochores to generate forces that are important for accurate chromosome segregation. Motor enzymes localized both at kinetochores and spindle poles help to form the biologically significant attachments between spindle fibers and their cargo, but microtubule-associated proteins without motor activity contribute to these junctions in important ways. This review examines the molecules necessary for chromosome-microtubule interaction in a range of well-studied organisms, using biological diversity to identify the factors that are essential for organized chromosome movement. We conclude that microtubule dynamics and the proteins that control them are likely to be more important for mitosis than the current enthusiasm for motor enzymes would suggest.},

Here we present a subnanometre-resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the human Ndc80 complex bound to microtubules, sufficient for precise docking of crystal structures of the component proteins. We find that the Ndc80 complex binds the microtubule with a tubulin monomer repeat, recognizing $\alpha$- and $\beta$-tubulin at both intra- and inter-tubulin dimer interfaces in a manner that is sensitive to tubulin conformation. Furthermore, Ndc80 complexes self-associate along protofilaments through interactions mediated by the amino-terminal tail of the NDC80 protein, which is the site of phospho-regulation by Aurora B kinase. The complex's mode of interaction with the microtubule and its oligomerization suggest a mechanism by which Aurora B could regulate the stability of load-bearing kinetochore-microtubule attachments.},

Here, we review recent works that have utilized quantitative image analysis to advance our understanding of the complex spindle structure of animal cells. In particular, we discuss how microtubules (MTs) are nucleated and distributed inside the spindle. Accumulating evidence supports the presence of MT-dependent MT generation within the spindle. This mechanism would produce dense arrays of intraspindle MTs with various lengths, which may contribute to efficient spindle assembly and stabilize the metaphase spindle. RNA interference (RNAi) screens with quantitative image analysis led to the identification of the augmin complex that plays a key role in this MT generation process. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Single-particle tracking (SPT) is often the rate-limiting step in live-cell imaging studies of subcellular dynamics. Here we present a tracking algorithm that addresses the principal challenges of SPT, namely high particle density, particle motion heterogeneity, temporary particle disappearance, and particle merging and splitting. The algorithm first links particles between consecutive frames and then links the resulting track segments into complete trajectories. Both steps are formulated as global combinatorial optimization problems whose solution identifies the overall most likely set of particle trajectories throughout a movie. Using this approach, we show that the GTPase dynamin differentially affects the kinetics of long- and short-lived endocytic structures and that the motion of CD36 receptors along cytoskeleton-mediated linear tracks increases their aggregation probability. Both applications indicate the requirement for robust and complete tracking of dense particle fields to dissect the mechanisms of receptor organization at the level of the plasma membrane.},

Popular models propose that checkpoint proteins associate with kinetochores to produce a "wait anaphase" signal that inhibits anaphase.

At least eight protein kinases are implicated in spindle checkpoint signaling, arguing that a traditional signal transduction cascade is integral to spindle checkpoint signaling. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Hochegger2013,
abstract = {The correct assembly and timely disassembly of the mitotic spindle is crucial for the propagation of the genome during cell division. Aurora kinases play a central role in orchestrating bipolar spindle establishment, chromosome alignment and segregation. In most eukaryotes, ranging from amoebas to humans, Aurora activity appears to be required both at the spindle pole and the kinetochore, and these activities are often split between two different Aurora paralogues, termed Aurora A and B. Polar and equatorial functions of Aurora kinases have generally been considered separately, with Aurora A being mostly involved in centrosome dynamics, whereas Aurora B coordinates kinetochore attachment and cytokinesis. However, double inactivation of both Aurora A and B results in a dramatic synergy that abolishes chromosome segregation. This suggests that these two activities jointly coordinate mitotic progression. Accordingly, recent evidence suggests that Aurora A and B work together in both spindle assembly in metaphase and disassembly in anaphase. Here, we provide an outlook on these shared functions of the Auroras, discuss the evolution of this family of mitotic kinases and speculate why Aurora kinase activity may be required at both ends of the spindle microtubules.},

@article{LaFountain2012,
abstract = {We report on experiments directly in living cells that reveal the regulation of kinetochore function by tension. X and Y sex chromosomes in crane fly (Nephrotoma suturalis) spermatocytes exhibit an atypical segregation mechanism in which each univalent maintains K-fibers to both poles. During anaphase, each maintains a leading fiber (which shortens) to one pole and a trailing fiber (which elongates) to the other. We used this intriguing behavior to study the motile states that X-Y kinetochores are able to support during anaphase. We used a laser microbeam to either sever a univalent along the plane of sister chromatid cohesion or knock out one of a univalent's two kinetochores to release one or both from the resistive influence of its sister's K-fiber. Released kinetochores with attached chromosome arms moved poleward at rates at least two times faster than normal. Furthermore, fluorescent speckle microscopy revealed that detached kinetochores converted their functional state from reverse pac-man to pac-man motility as a consequence of their release from mechanical tension. We conclude that kinetochores can exhibit pac-man motility, even though their normal behavior is dominated by traction fiber mechanics. Unleashing of kinetochore motility through loss of resistive force is further evidence for the emerging model that kinetochores are subject to tension-sensitive regulation.},

abstract = {How kinetochores bind to microtubules and move on the mitotic spindle remain unanswered questions. Multiple systems have implicated the Ndc80/Hec1 (Ndc80) kinetochore complex in kinetochore-microtubule interaction and spindle checkpoint activity [1–12]. In budding yeast, Ndc80 copurifies with three additional interacting proteins: Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25 [4, 5]. Although functional vertebrate homologs of Ndc80 and Nuf2 exist, extensive sequence similarity searches have not uncovered homologs of Spc24 and Spc25. We have purified the xNdc80 complex to homogeneity from Xenopus egg extracts and identified two novel interacting proteins. Although the sequences have greatly diverged, we have concluded that these are the functional homologs of the yeast Spc24 and Spc25 proteins based on limited sequence similarity, common coiled-coil domains, kinetochore localization, similar phenotypes, and copurification with xNdc80 and xNuf2. Using both RNAi and antibody injection experiments, we have extended previous characterization of the complex and found that Spc24 and Spc25 are required not only to establish, but also to maintain kinetochore-microtubule attachments and metaphase alignment. In addition, we show that Spc24 and Spc25 are required for chromosomal movement to the spindle poles in anaphase.},

These oscillations are coupled to changes in length of kMTs in a way that maintains a net stretch of the centromere. To understand how sister kinetochore directional instability and kMT plus-end dynamic instability are coupled to oscillations in centromere stretch, we tracked at high resolution the positions of fluorescent kinetochores and their poles for oscillating chromosomes within spindles of metaphase PtK1 cells. We found that the kinetics of P and AP movement are nonlinear and different. By subtracting contributions from the poleward flux of kMTs, we found that maximum centromere stretch occurred when the leading kinetochore switched from depolymerization to polymerization, whereas minimum centromere stretch occurred on average 7 s after the initially trailing kinetochore switched from polymerization to depolymerization. These differences produce oscillations in centromere stretch at about twice the frequency of kinetochore directional instability and at about twice the frequency of centromere oscillations back and forth across the spindle equator.},

abstract = {Background: Mitosis involves the interaction of many different components, including chromatin, microtubules, and motor proteins. Dissecting the mechanics of mitosis requires methods of studying not just each component in isolation, but also the entire ensemble of components in its full complexity in genetically tractable model organisms. Results: We have developed a mathematical framework for analyzing motion in four-dimensional microscopy data sets that allows us to measure elasticity, viscosity, and forces by tracking the conformational movements of mitotic chromosomes. We have used this approach to measure, for the first time, the basic biophysical parameters of mitosis in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster embryos. We found that Drosophila embryo chromosomes are significantly less rigid than the much larger chromosomes of vertebrates. Anaphase kinetochore force and nucleoplasmic viscosity were comparable with previous estimates in other species. Motion analysis also allowed us to measure the magnitude of the polar ejection force exerted on chromosome arms during metaphase by individual microtubules. We find the magnitude of this force to be approximately 1 pN, a number consistent with force generation either by collision of growing microtubules with chromosomes or by single kinesin motors. Conclusions: Motion analysis allows noninvasive mechanical measurements to be made in complex systems. This approach should allow the functional effects of Drosophila mitotic mutants on chromosome condensation, kinetochore forces, and the polar ejection force to be determined.},

abstract = {Chromosome segregation relies on the dynamic properties of spindle microtubules (MTs). Poleward MT flux contributes to spindle dynamics through the disassembly of MT minus ends at spindle poles coupled to the continuous poleward transport of spindle MTs [1, 2]. Despite being conserved in metazoan cells, the function of flux remains controversial because flux rates differ widely in different cell types. In meiotic systems, the rate of flux nearly matches that of chromosome movement [3-5], but in mitotic systems, flux is significantly slower than chromosome movement [6-8]. Here, we show that spindles in human mitotic cells depleted of the kinesin-13 proteins Kif2a and MCAK lack detectable flux and that such cells frequently fail to segregate all chromosomes appropriately at anaphase. Elimination of flux reduces poleward chromosome velocity ???20{\%}, but does not hinder bipolar spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, or mitotic progression. Thus, mitosis proceeds efficiently in human cells lacking detectable poleward MT flux. These data demonstrate that in human cultured cells, kinetochores are sufficient to effectively power chromosome movement, leading us to speculate that flux is maintained in these cells to fulfill other functional roles such as error correction or kinetochore regulation. ??2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Following DNA replication, eukaryotic cells must biorient all sister chromatids prior to cohesion cleavage at anaphase. In animal cells, sister chromatids gradually biorient during prometaphase, but current models of mitosis in S. cerevisiae assume that biorientation is established shortly after S phase. This assumption is based on the observation of a bilobed distribution of yeast kinetochores early in mitosis and suggests fundamental differences between yeast mitosis and mitosis in animal cells. By applying super-resolution imaging methods, we show that yeast and animal cells share the key property of gradual and stochastic chromosome biorientation. The characteristic bilobed distribution of yeast kinetochores, hitherto considered synonymous for biorientation, arises from kinetochores in mixed attachment states to microtubules, the length of which discriminates bioriented from syntelic attachments. Our results offer a revised view of mitotic progression in S. cerevisiae that augments the relevance of mechanistic information obtained in this powerful genetic system for mammalian mitosis. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The kinesins-8 were originally thought to be microtubule depolymerases, but are now emerging as more versatile catalysts of microtubule dynamics. We show here that S. pombe Klp5-436 and Klp6-440 are non-processive plus-end-directed motors whose in vitro velocities on S. pombe microtubules at 7 and 23 nm s−1 are too slow to keep pace with the growing tips of dynamic interphase microtubules in living S. pombe. In vitro, Klp5 and 6 dimers exhibit a hitherto-undescribed combination of strong enhancement of microtubule nucleation with no effect on growth rate or catastrophe frequency. By contrast in vivo, both Klp5 and Klp6 promote microtubule catastrophe at cell ends whilst Klp6 also increases the number of interphase microtubule arrays (IMAs). Our data support a model in which Klp5/6 bind tightly to free tubulin heterodimers, strongly promoting the nucleation of new microtubules, and then continue to land as a tubulin-motor complex on the tips of growing microtubules, with the motors then dissociating after a few seconds residence on the lattice. In vivo, we predict that only at cell ends, when growing microtubule tips become lodged and their growth slows down, will Klp5/6 motor activity succeed in tracking growing microtubule tips. This mechanism would allow Klp5/6 to detect the arrival of microtubule tips at cells ends and to amplify the intrinsic tendency for microtubules to catastrophise in compression at cell ends. Our evidence identifies Klp5 and 6 as spatial regulators of microtubule dynamics that enhance both microtubule nucleation at the cell centre and microtubule catastrophe at the cell ends.},

abstract = {Mitotic spindle length control requires coordination between microtubule (MT) dynamics and motor-generated forces. To investigate how MT plus-end polymerization contributes to spindle length in Drosophila embryos, we studied the dynamics of the MT plus-end depolymerase, kinesin-8, and the effects of kinesin-8 inhibition using mutants and antibody microinjection. As expected, kinesin-8 was found to contribute to anaphase A. Furthermore, kinesin-8 depletion caused: (i) excessive polymerization of interpolar (ip) MT plus ends, which "overgrow" to penetrate distal half spindles; (ii) an increase in the poleward ipMT sliding rate that is coupled to MT plus-end polymerization; (iii) premature spindle elongation during metaphase/anaphase A; and (iv) an increase in the anaphase B spindle elongation rate which correlates linearly with the MT sliding rate. This is best explained by a revised "ipMT sliding/minus-end depolymerization" model for spindle length control which incorporates a coupling between ipMT plus end dynamics and the outward ipMT sliding that drives poleward flux and spindle elongation.},

abstract = {The spindle is a dynamic self-assembling machine that coordinates mitosis. The spindle's function depends on its ability to organize microtubules into poles and maintain pole structure despite mechanical challenges and component turnover. Although we know that dynein and NuMA mediate pole formation, our understanding of the forces dynamically maintaining poles is limited: we do not know where and how quickly they act or their strength and structural impact. Using laser ablation to cut spindle microtubules, we identify a force that rapidly and robustly pulls severed microtubules and chromosomes poleward, overpowering opposing forces and repairing spindle architecture. Molecular imaging and biophysical analysis suggest that transport is powered by dynein pulling on minus ends of severed microtubules. NuMA and dynein/dynactin are specifically enriched at new minus ends within seconds, reanchoring minus ends to the spindle and delivering them to poles. This force on minus ends represents a newly uncovered chromosome transport mechanism that is independent of plus end forces at kinetochores and is well suited to robustly maintain spindle mechanical integrity.},

abstract = {Background: Polar ejection forces have often been hypothesized to guide directional instability of mitotic chromosomes, but a direct link has never been established. This has led, in part, to the resurgence of alternative theories. By taking advantage of extremely precise femtosecond pulsed laser microsurgery, we abruptly alter the magnitude of polar ejection forces by severing vertebrate chromosome arms. Results: Reduction of polar ejection forces increases the amplitude of directional instability without altering other characteristics, thus establishing a direct link between polar ejection forces and the direction of chromosome movements. We find that polar ejection forces limit the range of chromosome oscillations by increasing the probability that motors at a leading kinetochore abruptly disengage or turn off, leading to a direction reversal. Conclusions: From the relation between the change in oscillation amplitude and the amount a chromosome arm is shortened, we are able to map the distribution of polar ejection forces across the spindle, which is surprisingly different from previously assumed distributions. These results allow us to differentiate between the mechanisms proposed to underlie the directional instability of chromosomes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: The accurate alignment of chromosomes at the spindle equator is fundamental for the equal distribution of the genome in mitosis and thus for the genetic integrity of eukaryotes. Although it is well established that chromosome movements are coupled to microtubule dynamics, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Results: By combining RNAi-depletion experiments with in vitro biochemical assays, we demonstrate that the human kinesin Kif18A is a motile microtubule depolymerase essential for chromosome congression in mammalian tissue culture cells. We show that in vitro Kif18A is a slow plus-end-directed kinesin that possesses microtubule depolymerizing activity. Notably, Kif18A like its yeast ortholog Kip3p depolymerizes longer microtubules more quickly than shorter ones. In vivo, Kif18A accumulates in mitosis where it localizes close to the plus ends of kinetochore microtubules. The depletion of Kif18A induces aberrantly long mitotic spindles and loss of tension across sister kinetochores, resulting in the activation of the Mad2-dependent spindle-assembly checkpoint. Live-cell microscopy studies revealed that in Kif18A-depleted cells, chromosomes move at reduced speed and completely fail to align at the spindle equator. Conclusions: These studies identify Kif18A as a dual-functional kinesin and a key component of chromosome congression in mammalian cells. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In particular, we analyze the interphase checkpoint inS. pombe,where the wild-type cell confirms that S phase is complete and that the cell is large enough to finish the division cycle. In our model, incomplete DNA replication restrains the onset of M phase by inhibiting Cdc25 and activating Mikl, whereas increasing size biases the cell towards mitosis by down-regulating Weel.

Here, we investigate how plus-end-directed depolymerases of the kinesin-8 family regulate MT depolymerization dynamics. Using an individual-based model, we reproduce experimental findings. Moreover, crowding is identified as the key regulatory mechanism of depolymerization dynamics. Our analysis reveals two qualitatively distinct regimes. For motor densities above a particular threshold, a macroscopic traffic jam emerges at the plus-end and the MT dynamics become independent of the motor concentration. Below this threshold, microscopic traffic jams at the tip arise that cancel out the effect of the depolymerization kinetics such that the depolymerization speed is solely determined by the motor density. Because this density changes over the MT length, length-dependent regulation is possible. Remarkably, motor cooperativity affects only the end-residence time of depolymerases and not the depolymerization speed. ?? 2011 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Mitotic chromosome motions are driven by microtubules (MTs) and associated proteins that couple kinetochores to MT ends. A good coupler should ensure a high stability of attachment, even when the chromosome changes direction or experiences a large opposing force. The optimal coupler is also expected to be efficient in converting the energy of MT depolymerization into chromosome motility. As was shown years ago, a "sleeve"-based, chromosome-associated structure could, in principle, couple MT dynamics to chromosome motion. A recently identified kinetochore complex from yeast, the "Dam1" or "DASH" complex, may function as an encircling coupler in vivo. Some features of the Dam1 ring differ from those of the "sleeve," but whether these differences are significant has not been examined. Here, we analyze theoretically the biomechanical properties of encircling couplers that have properties of the Dam1/DASH complex, such as its large diameter and inward-directed extensions. We demonstrate that, if the coupler is modeled as a wide ring with links that bind the MT wall, its optimal performance is achieved when the linkers are flexible and their binding to tubulin dimers is strong. The diffusive movement of such a coupler is limited, but MT depolymerization can drive its motion via a "forced walk," whose features differ significantly from those of the mechanisms based on biased diffusion. Our analysis identifies key experimental parameters whose values should determine whether the Dam1/DASH ring moves via diffusion or a forced walk.},

abstract = {During mitosis, "polar ejection forces" (PEFs) are hypothesized to direct prometaphase chromosome movements by pushing chromosome arms toward the spindle equator. PEFs are postulated to be caused by (i) plus-end-directed microtubule (MT)-based motor proteins on the chromosome arms, namely chromokinesins, and (ii) the polymerization of spindle MTs into the chromosome. However, the exact role of PEFs is unclear, because little is known about their magnitude or their forms (e.g., impulsive vs. sustained, etc.). In this study, we employ optical tweezers to bring about the lateral interaction between chromosome arms and MTs in vitro to directly measure the speed and force of the PEFs developed on chromosome arms. We find that forces are unidirectional and frequently exceed 1 pN, with maximum forces of 2-3 pN and peak velocities of 63 +/- 41 nm/s; the movements are ATP-dependent and exhibit a characteristic noncontinuous motion that includes displacements of >50 nm, stalls, and backwards slippage of the MT even under low loads. We perform experiments using antibodies to the chromokinesins Kid and KIF4 that identify Kid as the principal force-producing agent for PEFs. At first glance, this motor activity appears surprisingly weak and erratic, but it explains how PEFs can guide chromosome movements without severely deforming or damaging the local chromosome structure.},

abstract = {Microtubules (MTs) are important components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton: they contribute to cell shape and movement, as well as to the motions of organelles including mitotic chromosomes. MTs bind motor enzymes that drive many such movements, but MT dynamics can also contribute to organelle motility. Each MT polymer is a store of chemical energy that can be used to do mechanical work, but how this energy is converted to motility remains unknown. Here we show, by conjugating glass microbeads to tubulin polymers through strong inert linkages, such as biotin-avidin, that depolymerizing MTs exert a brief tug on the beads, as measured with laser tweezers. Analysis of these interactions with a molecular-mechanical model of MT structure and force production shows that a single depolymerizing MT can generate about ten times the force that is developed by a motor enzyme; thus, this mechanism might be the primary driving force for chromosome motion. Because even the simple coupler used here slows MT disassembly, physiological couplers may modulate MT dynamics in vivo.},

abstract = {Solid tumors can be highly aneuploid and many display high rates of chromosome missegregation in a phenomenon called chromosomal instability (CIN). In principle, aneuploidy is the consequence of CIN, but the relationship between CIN and aneuploidy has not been clearly defined. In this study, we use live cell imaging and clonal cell analyses to evaluate the fidelity of chromosome segregation in chromosomally stable and unstable human cells. We show that improper microtubule-chromosome attachment (merotely) is a cause of chromosome missegregation in unstable cells and that increasing chromosome missegregation rates by elevating merotely during consecutive mitoses generates CIN in otherwise stable, near-diploid cells. However, chromosome missegregation compromises the proliferation of diploid cells, indicating that phenotypic changes that permit the propagation of nondiploid cells must combine with elevated chromosome missegregation rates to generate aneuploid cells with CIN.},

We first provide a review of the experimental and modeling literature, and then present a new model of microtubule dynamics. We demonstrate that vectorial, random, and coupled hydrolysis mechanisms are not consistent with the dependence of catastrophe on tubulin concentration and show that, although single-protofilament models can explain many features of dynamics, they do not describe catastrophe as a multistep process. Finally, we present a new combined (coupled plus random hydrolysis) multiple-protofilament model that is a simple, analytically solvable generalization of a single-protofilament model. This model accounts for the observed lifetimes of growing microtubules, the delay to catastrophe following dilution and describes catastrophe as a multistep process.},

These oscillations must be spatially constrained in order to align and segregate chromosomes with high fidelity, but the molecular mechanism for this activity is uncertain. We report here that the human kinesin-8 Kif18A has a primary role in the control of chromosome oscillations. Kif18A accumulates as a gradient on kinetochore microtubules in a manner dependent on its motor activity. Quantitative analyses of kinetochore movements reveal that Kif18A reduces the amplitude of preanaphase oscillations and slows poleward movement during anaphase. Thus, the microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin Kif18A has the unexpected function of suppressing chromosome movements. Based on these findings, we propose a molecular model in which Kif18A regulates kinetochore microtubule dynamics to control mitotic chromosome positioning. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have implicated Kin Is, unique kinesins that depolymerize microtubules, in regulating chromosome positioning. We have characterized the immunofluorescence localization of centromere-bound MCAK and found that MCAK localized to inner kinetochores during prophase but was predominantly centromeric by metaphase. Interestingly, MCAK accumulated at leading kinetochores during congression but not during segregation. We tested the consequences of MCAK disruption by injecting a centromere dominant-negative protein into prophase cells. Depletion of centromeric MCAK led to reduced centromere stretch, delayed chromosome congression, alignment defects, and severe missegregation of chromosomes. Rates of chromosome movement were unchanged, suggesting that the primary role of MCAK is not to move chromosomes. Furthermore, we found that disruption of MCAK leads to multiple kinetochore-microtubule attachment defects, including merotelic, syntelic, and combined merotelic-syntelic attachments. These findings reveal an essential role for Kin Is in prevention and/or correction of improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: During anaphase B in mitosis, polymerization and sliding of overlapping spindle microtubules (MTs) contribute to the outward movement the spindle pole bodies (SPBs). To probe the mechanism of spindle elongation, we combine fluorescence microscopy, photobleaching, and laser microsurgery in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

RESULTS: We demonstrate that a green laser cuts intracellular structures in yeast cells with high spatial specificity. By using laser microsurgery, we cut mitotic spindles labeled with GFP-tubulin at various stages of anaphase B. Although cutting generally caused early anaphase spindles to disassemble, midanaphase spindle fragments continued to elongate. In particular, when the spindle was cut near a SPB, the larger spindle fragment continued to elongate in the direction of the cut. Photobleach marks showed that sliding of overlapping midzone MTs was responsible for the elongation of the spindle fragment. Spindle midzone fragments not connected to either of the two spindle poles also elongated. Equatorial microtubule organizing center (eMTOC) activity was not affected in cells with one detached pole but was delayed or absent in cells with two detached poles.

CONCLUSIONS: These studies reveal that the spindle midzone is necessary and sufficient for the stabilization of MT ends and for spindle elongation. By contrast, SPBs are not required for elongation, but they contribute to the attachment of the nuclear envelope and chromosomes to the spindle, and to cell cycle progression. Laser microsurgery provides a means by which to dissect the mechanics of the spindle in yeast.},

@article{Joglekar2002,
abstract = {During mitosis, chromosomes become attached to microtubules that emanate from the two spindle poles. Thereafter, a chromosome moves along these microtubule "tracks" as it executes a series of movements that bring it to the spindle equator. After the onset of anaphase, the sister chromatids separate and move to opposite spindle poles. These movements are often characterized by "directional instability" (a series of runs with approximately constant speed, punctuated by sudden reversals in the direction of movement). To understand mitosis, it is critical to describe the physical mechanisms that underlie the coordination of the forces that drive directional instability. We propose a simple mechanistic model that describes the origin of the forces that move chromosomes and the coordination of these forces to produce directional instability. The model demonstrates that forces, speeds, and direction of motion associated with prometaphase through anaphase chromosome movements can be predicted from the molecular kinetics of interactions between dynamic microtubules and arrays of microtubule binding sites that are linked to the chromosome by compliant elements.},

Here, we demonstrate that Kip3p is both a plus end-directed motor and a plus end-specific depolymerase--a unique combination of activities not found in other kinesins. The ATPase activity of Kip3p was activated by both microtubules and unpolymerized tubulin. Furthermore, Kip3p in the ATP-bound state formed a complex with unpolymerized tubulin. Thus, motile kinesin-8s may depolymerize microtubules by a mechanism that is similar to that used by non-motile kinesin-13 proteins. Fluorescent speckle analysis established that, in vivo, Kip3p moved toward and accumulated on the plus ends of growing microtubules, suggesting that motor activity brings Kip3p to its site of action. Globally, and more dramatically on cortical contact, Kip3p promoted catastrophes and pausing, and inhibited microtubule growth. These findings explain the role of Kip3p in positioning the mitotic spindle in budding yeast and potentially other processes controlled by kinesin-8 family members.},

abstract = {For proper chromosome segregation, sister kinetochores must interact with microtubules from opposite spindle poles (bi-orientation). To establish bi-orientation, aberrant kinetochore–microtubule attachments are disrupted (error correction) by aurora B kinase (Ipl1 in budding yeast). Paradoxically, during this disruption, new attachments are still formed efficiently to enable fresh attempts at bi-orientation. How this is possible remains an enigma. Here we show that kinetochore attachment to the microtubule lattice (lateral attachment) is impervious to aurora B regulation, but attachment to the microtubule plus end (end-on attachment) is disrupted by this kinase. Thus, a new lateral attachment is formed without interference, then converted to end-on attachment and released if incorrect. This process continues until bi-orientation is established and stabilized by tension across sister kinetochores. We reveal how aurora B specifically promotes disruption of the end-on attachment through phospho-regulation of kinetochore components Dam1 and Ndc80. Our results reveal fundamental mechanisms for promoting error correction for bi-orientation.},

To help rectify this deficit in knowledge, experimental data, accumulated from a huge number of different studies, can be integrated into theoretical models of the tumor-immune system interaction. Many complex mechanisms in immunology and oncology cannot be measured in experiments, but can be analyzed by mathematical simulations. Using theoretical modeling techniques, general principles of tumor-immune system interactions can be explored and clinical treatment schedules optimized to lower both tumor burden and side effects.

abstract = {Micromanipulation of living grasshopper spermatocytes in anaphase has been combined with electron microscopy to reveal otherwise obscure features of spindle organization. A chromosome is pushed laterally outside the spindle and stretched, and the cell is fixed with a novel, agar-treated glutaraldehyde solution. Two- and three-dimensional reconstructions from serial sections of seven cells show that kinetochore microtubules of the manipulated chromosome are shifted outside the confusing thicket of spindle microtubules and mechanical associations among microtubules are revealed by bent or shifted microtubules. These are the chief results: (a) The disposition of microtubules invariably is consistent with a skeletal role for spindle microtubules. (b) The kinetochore microtubule bundle is composed of short and long microtubules, with weak but recognizable mechanical associations among them. Some kinetochore microtubules are more tightly linked to one other microtubule within the bundle. (c) Microtubules of the kinetochore microtubule bundle are firmly connected to other spindle microtubules only near the pole, although some nonkinetochore microtubules of uncertain significance enter the bundle nearer to the kinetochore. (d) The kinetochore microtubules of adjacent chromosomes are mechanically linked, which provides an explanation for interdependent chromosome movement in "hinge anaphases." In the region of the spindle open to analysis after chromosome micromanipulation, microtubules may be linked mechanically by embedment in a gel, rather than by dynein or other specific, cross-bridging molecules.},

abstract = {The force the spindle exerts on a single moving chromosome in anaphase was measured with a flexible glass needle calibrated in dynes per micron of tip deflection. The needle was used to produce a force on the chromosome, which opposed that produced by the spindle and was measurable from needle tip deflection. The measurements were made in intact grasshopper spermatocytes after proving that the presence of materials such as the cell surface did not interfere. The results from 12 experiments in seven cells are as follows: Chromosome velocity was not affected until the opposing force reached approximately 10(-5) dyn, and then fell rapidly with increasing force. The opposing force that caused chromosome velocity to fall to zero--the force that matched the maximum force the spindle could produce--was of order 7 X 10(-5) dyn. This directly measured maximum force potential is nearly 10,000 times greater than the calculated value of 10(-8) dyn for normal chromosome movement, in which only viscous resistance to movement must be overcome. The spindle's unexpectedly large force potential prompts a fresh look at molecular models for the mitotic motor, at velocity-limiting governors, and at the possibility that force may sometimes affect microtubule length and stability.},

The kinetochore also provides a powerful signaling function that is able to alter the properties of the spindle checkpoint and initiate a signal transduction cascade that leads to inhibition of the anaphase promoting complex and cell cycle arrest. Together, the kinetochore accomplishes the feat of chromosome segregation with unparalleled accuracy. Errors in segregation lead to Down's syndrome, the most frequent inherited birth defect, pregnancy loss, and cancer. Over a century after the discovery of the kinetochore, an architectural map comprising greater than 100 proteins is emerging.

abstract = {Experimentally introduced tension on kinetochores and their centromeres has been shown to stabilize kinetochore attachment to microtubules, modify kinetochore directional instability, and regulate cell-cycle progression into anaphase. In mitosis, kinetochore tension and the stretch of centromere chromatin are produced by the movement of sister kinetochores toward opposite poles and astral ejection forces on the chromosome arms. However, newt lung cell kinetochores oscillate between poleward and away from the pole motility states throughout mitosis, indicating kinetochores are not under constant tension. To test whether kinetochores are under net tension while they are oscillating, and how often they are under compression and pushing into the chromosome, we measured the distance between sister kinetochores in newt lung cells using both video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy (VE-DIC) and immunofluorescence microscopy. We found that for chromosomes in which sister kinetochores are attached to opposite spindle poles, centromeres are, on average, stretched (2.2 microns in living cells and 1.8 microns in fixed cells) with respect to the inter-kinetochore 'rest' length (1.1 microns in living and fixed cells). For chromosomes in which only one kinetochore is attached to the spindle, the centromere chromatin associated with the tethered kinetochore is, on average, stretched to approximately half of the average inter-kinetochore distance measured for chromosomes in which both kinetochores are attached. We conclude that while newt lung cell kinetochores oscillate between states of P and AP movement, they are under tension approximately 90{\%} of the time and under compression less than 6{\%} of the time.},

abstract = {In cells, a complex network of proteins regulates the dynamic growth of microtubules that is essential for division and migration. In vitro approaches with purified components have so far been unable to reconstitute fast microtubule growth observed in vivo . Here we show that two well-studied plus-end-binding proteins-end-tracking protein EB1 and microtubule polymerase XMAP215-act together to strongly promote microtubule growth to cellular rates. Unexpectedly, the combined effects of XMAP215 and EB1 are highly synergistic, with acceleration of growth well beyond the product of the individual effects of either protein. The synergistic growth promotion does not rely on any of the canonical EB1 interactions, suggesting an allosteric interaction through the microtubule end. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that taxol and XMAP215, which have non-overlapping binding sites on tubulin, also act synergistically on growth. The increase in growth rates is accompanied by a strong enhancement of microtubule catastrophe by EB1, thereby rendering the fast and dynamic microtubule behaviour typically observed in cells.},

abstract = {Chromosome segregation during mitosis requires chromosomes to undergo bipolar attachment on spindle microtubules (MTs) and subsequent silencing of the spindle checkpoint. Here, we describe the identification and characterisation of a novel spindle and kinetochore (KT)-associated complex that is required for timely anaphase onset. The complex comprises at least two proteins, termed Ska1 (Spindle and KT Associated 1) and Ska2. Ska1 associates with KTs following MT attachment during prometaphase. Ska1 and Ska2 interact with each other and Ska1 is required for Ska2 stability in vivo. Depletion of either Ska1 or Ska2 by small interfering RNA results in the loss of both proteins from the KT. The absence of Ska proteins does not disrupt overall KT structure, but KT fibres show an increased cold-sensitivity. Most strikingly, Ska-depleted cells undergo a prolonged checkpoint-dependent delay in a metaphase-like state. This delay is characterised by the recruitment of Mad2 protein to a few KTs and the occasional loss of individual chromosomes from the metaphase plate. These data suggest that the Ska1/2 complex plays a critical role in the maintenance of the metaphase plate and/or spindle checkpoint silencing.},

abstract = {We identified a truncated allele of dam1 as a multicopy suppressor of the sensitivity of cdc13-117 (cyclin B) and mal3-1 (EB-1) cells to thiabendazole, a microtubule poison. We find that Dam1 binds to the plus end of spindle microtubules and kinetochores as cells enter mitosis and this is dependent on other components of the fission yeast DASH complex, including Ask1, Duo1, Spc34 and Dad1. By contrast, Dad1 remains bound to kinetochores throughout the cell cycle and its association is dependent on the Mis6 and Mal2, but not Mis12, Nuf2 or Cnp1, kinetochore proteins. In cells lacking Dam1, or other components of the DASH complex, anaphase is delayed due to activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and lagging sister chromatids are frequently observed and occasionally sister chromatid pairs segregate to the same spindle pole. We find that the mitotic centromere-associated Klp5/Klp6 kinesin complex is essential in cells lacking components of the DASH complex. Cells lacking both Dam1 and Klp5 undergo a first cell cycle arrest in mitosis due to a failure to establish bipolar chromosome attachment.},

abstract = {Dynamic instability, the stochastic switching between growth and shrinkage, is essential for microtubule function. This behavior is driven by GTP hydrolysis in the microtubule lattice and is inhibited by anticancer agents like Taxol. We provide insight into the mechanism of dynamic instability, based on high-resolution cryo-EM structures (4.7-5.6 {\AA}) of dynamic microtubules and microtubules stabilized by GMPCPP or Taxol. We infer that hydrolysis leads to a compaction around the E-site nucleotide at longitudinal interfaces, as well as movement of the $\alpha$-tubulin intermediate domain and H7 helix. Displacement of the C-terminal helices in both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-tubulin subunits suggests an effect on interactions with binding partners that contact this region. Taxol inhibits most of these conformational changes, allosterically inducing a GMPCPP-like state. Lateral interactions are similar in all conditions we examined, suggesting that microtubule lattice stability is primarily modulated at longitudinal interfaces. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Dynamic instability, in which abrupt transitions occur between growing and shrinking states, is an intrinsic property of microtubules that is regulated by both mechanics and specialized proteins. We discuss a model of dynamic instability based on the popular idea that growth is maintained by a cap at the tip of the fiber. The loss of this cap is thought to trigger the transition from growth to shrinkage, called a catastrophe. The model includes longitudinal interactions between the terminal tubulins of each protofilament and "gating rescues" between neighboring protofilaments. These interactions allow individual protofilaments to transiently shorten during a phase of overall microtubule growth. The model reproduces the reported dependency of the catastrophe rate on tubulin concentration, the time between tubulin dilution and catastrophe, and the induction of microtubule catastrophes by walking depolymerases. The model also reproduces the comet tail distribution that is characteristic of proteins that bind to the tips of growing microtubules.},

abstract = {Metaphase describes a phase of mitosis where chromosomes are attached and oriented on the bipolar spindle for subsequent segregation at anaphase. In diverse cell types, the metaphase spindle is maintained at characteristic constant length [1-3]. Metaphase spindle length is proposed to be regulated by a balance of pushing and pulling forces generated by distinct sets of spindle microtubules (MTs) and their interactions with motors and MT-associated proteins (MAPs). Spindle length is further proposed to be important for chromosome segregation fidelity, as cells with shorter- or longer-than-normal metaphase spindles, generated through deletion or inhibition of individual mitotic motors or MAPs, showed chromosome segregation defects. To test the force-balance model of spindle length control and its effect on chromosome segregation, we applied fast microfluidic temperature control with live-cell imaging to monitor the effect of deleting or switching off different combinations of antagonistic force contributors in the fission yeast metaphase spindle. We show that the spindle midzone proteins kinesin-5 cut7p and MT bundler ase1p contribute to outward-pushing forces and that the spindle kinetochore proteins kinesin-8 klp5/6p and dam1p contribute to inward-pulling forces. Removing these proteins individually led to aberrant metaphase spindle length and chromosome segregation defects. Removing these proteins in antagonistic combination rescued the defective spindle length and in some combinations also partially rescued chromosome segregation defects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Grishchuk2008,
abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation during mitotic division of budding yeast depends on the multiprotein kinetochore complex, Dam1 (also known as DASH). Purified Dam1 heterodecamers encircle microtubules (MTs) to form rings that can function as "couplers," molecular devices that transduce energy from MT disassembly into the motion of a cargo. Here we show that MT depolymerization develops a force against a Dam1 ring that is sixfold larger than the force exerted on a coupler that binds only one side of an MT. Wild-type rings slow depolymerization fourfold, but rings that include a mutant Dam1p with truncated C terminus slow depolymerization less, consistent with the idea that this tail is part of a strong bond between rings and MTs. A molecular-mechanical model for Dam1-MT interaction predicts that binding between this flexible tail and the MT wall should cause a Dam1 ring to wobble, and Fourier analysis of moving, ring-attached beads corroborates this prediction. Comparison of the forces generated against wild-type and mutant complexes confirms the importance of tight Dam1-MT association for processive cargo movement under load.},

@article{Vogel2007,
abstract = {In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, interphase microtubules (MTs) position the nucleus [1, 2], which in turn positions the cell-division plane [1, 3]. It is unclear how the spindle orients, with respect to the predetermined division plane, to ensure that the chromosomes are segregated across this plane. It has been proposed that, during prometaphase, the astral MT interaction with the cell cortex aligns the spindle with the cell axis [4] and also participates in a spindle orientation checkpoint (SOC), which delays entry into anaphase as long as the spindle is misaligned [5-7]. Here, we trace the position of the spindle throughout mitosis in a single-cell assay. We find no evidence for the SOC. We show that the spindle is remarkably well aligned with the cell longitudinal axis at the onset of mitosis, by growing along the axis of the adjacent interphase MT. Misalignment of nascent spindles can give rise to anucleate cells when spindle elongation is impaired. We propose a new role for interphase microtubules: through interaction with the spindle pole body, interphase microtubules determine the initial alignment of the spindle in the subsequent cell division.},

@article{Daga2008,
abstract = {Correct spindle alignment requires a cell to detect and interpret its global geometry and to communicate this information to the mitotic spindle. In the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the mitotic spindle is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the rod-shaped cell. Here, using wild-type and cell-shape mutants we investigate the mechanism of initial spindle alignment and show that attachment of interphase microtubules to the spindle pole bodies (SPB), the yeast equivalent of the centrosome, is required to align duplicated SPBs, and thus the mitotic spindle, with the long axis of the cell. In the absence of interphase microtubules or attachment between the microtubules and the SPB, newly formed spindles are randomly oriented. We show that the axis of the mitotic spindle correlates with the axis along which the SPB, as a consequence of interphase microtubule dynamics, oscillates just before mitosis. We propose that cell geometry guides cytoplasmic microtubule alignment, which in turn, determines initial spindle alignment, and demonstrate that a failure of the spindle pre-alignment mechanism results in unequal chromosome segregation when spindle length is reduced.},

@article{Wan2012a,
abstract = {Kinetochores bound to kinetochore microtubules (kMTs) exhibit directional instability in mammalian and other mitotic vertebrate cells, oscillating between poleward (P) and away-from-the-pole (AP) movements. These oscillations are coupled to changes in length of kMTs in a way that maintains a net stretch of the centromere. To understand how sister kinetochore directional instability and kMT plus-end dynamic instability are coupled to oscillations in centromere stretch, we tracked at high resolution the positions of fluorescent kinetochores and their poles for oscillating chromosomes within spindles of metaphase PtK1 cells. We found that the kinetics of P and AP movement are nonlinear and different. By subtracting contributions from the poleward flux of kMTs, we found that maximum centromere stretch occurred when the leading kinetochore switched from depolymerization to polymerization, whereas minimum centromere stretch occurred on average 7 s after the initially trailing kinetochore switched from polymerization to depolymerization. These differences produce oscillations in centromere stretch at about twice the frequency of kinetochore directional instability and at about twice the frequency of centromere oscillations back and forth across the spindle equator.},

@article{Wang2010a,
abstract = {Mitotic spindle length control requires coordination between microtubule (MT) dynamics and motor-generated forces. To investigate how MT plus-end polymerization contributes to spindle length in Drosophila embryos, we studied the dynamics of the MT plus-end depolymerase, kinesin-8, and the effects of kinesin-8 inhibition using mutants and antibody microinjection. As expected, kinesin-8 was found to contribute to anaphase A. Furthermore, kinesin-8 depletion caused: (i) excessive polymerization of interpolar (ip) MT plus ends, which "overgrow" to penetrate distal half spindles; (ii) an increase in the poleward ipMT sliding rate that is coupled to MT plus-end polymerization; (iii) premature spindle elongation during metaphase/anaphase A; and (iv) an increase in the anaphase B spindle elongation rate which correlates linearly with the MT sliding rate. This is best explained by a revised "ipMT sliding/minus-end depolymerization" model for spindle length control which incorporates a coupling between ipMT plus end dynamics and the outward ipMT sliding that drives poleward flux and spindle elongation.},
